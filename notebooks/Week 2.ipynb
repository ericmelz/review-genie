Expect rain, strong winds, and a temperature drop. Sunshine returns Friday, but the weekend brings showers and flurries\\n\\nToronto is waking up to a damp and blustery start this Thursday, March 20, 2025. The temperature is currently sitting at 13.6°C, but don’t get too comfortable—it’s expected to take a nosedive by the afternoon. Light rain is falling over the city, with a southwest wind howling at 36 km/h, gusting even stronger as the day goes on. The barometric pressure sits at 99.7 kPa and is falling, which means unsettled weather ahead. Humidity is at 68%, making it feel a bit damp.\\n\\nToday: Showers, Wind, and a Temperature Plunge\\n\\nExpect mainly cloudy skies with a 70% chance of showers this morning, tapering to a 30% chance near noon. But don’t let your guard down—the wind is switching directions and picking up speed. Southwest winds of 30 km/h, gusting to 50 km/h, will shift northwest this afternoon, gusting up to 60 km/h. While the morning starts mild, temperatures will fall sharply to just 2°C by the afternoon. With a UV index of 4, some sunny breaks could make an appearance, so don’t rule out a little brightness between the raindrops.\\n\\nTonight: A Little Bit of Everything\\n\\nThis evening will see lingering rain showers transitioning to flurries—yes, you read that right. Welcome to spring in Toronto! The skies will turn partly cloudy overnight, but the wind remains strong from the northwest at 30 km/h, gusting up to 60 km/h. Temperatures will drop to -4°C, with a wind chill making it feel like -9°C. Time to swap the raincoat for the winter jacket again.\\n\\nFriday: Sunshine and a Slight Warm-Up\\n\\nFriday brings a welcome change with sunny skies and a high of 9°C. However, the morning will start off chilly, with a wind chill of -6°C. The wind will be back in action, shifting to the south at 20 km/h, gusting to 40 km/h by late morning. The UV index remains at 4, so keep those sunglasses handy.\\n\\nWeekend Outlook: A Rollercoaster Forecast\\n\\nWhat to Wear?\\n\\nLayer up and prepare for changing conditions.

The company was founded in 1993 and is headquartered in San Jose, California. Super Micro has become a trusted partner in the technology industry, focusing on delivering advanced computing solutions to a diverse range of customers, including data centers, cloud computing providers, and enterprises. The company\\'s products include server systems, storage solutions, networking devices, and software.\\nChief Executive Officer and founder Charles Liang leads Super Micro\\'s management team. Liang has over 30 years of experience in the technology industry and is widely regarded as a pioneer in server technology. Under his leadership, Super Micro has grown into a global enterprise with operations in over 20 countries.\\nOver the past few years, Super Micro has experienced steady revenue growth, with a reported revenue increasing yearly. The company has maintained a healthy profit margin of over 10% in recent years, indicating strong financial performance. Debt levels have remained relatively stable over the past few years, and the company has not undergone any significant changes in ownership. Super Micro\\'s current valuation metrics, such as price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, compare favorably to industry peers. The company\\'s stock is currently trading at a reasonable valuation, reflecting the market\\'s positive outlook on the company\\'s prospects. Super Micro\\'s stock has experienced some significant price movements in recent years. In early 2020, the stock price experienced a decline due to concerns over the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the technology industry. However, the stock quickly rebounded and has since recovered 5X its value after the dip. In the recent past, the stock has continued to climb, reflecting the company\\'s strong financial performance and positive market outlook.\\nSuper Micro operates in the highly competitive technology industry, constantly evolving due to technological advancements and changing consumer preferences. The industry is also subject to regulatory and political issues, such as data privacy concerns and government policies that impact the import and export of technology products. Super Micro faces competition from established players such as Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and IBM, as well as emerging players in cloud computing and artificial intelligence.\\nSuper Micro is well-positioned to take advantage of several potential growth opportunities. The company has a strong track record of innovation and is constantly developing new products and solutions to meet the evolving needs of its customers. Super Micro has expanded into new markets, such as the rapidly-growing cloud computing space and has made several strategic acquisitions to enhance its product portfolio. The company\\'s focus on energy efficiency and sustainability also aligns with the growing demand for environmentally-friendly technology solutions.\\nDespite its strong financial performance and positive outlook, Super Micro faces several potential risks and challenges. The technology industry is highly competitive, and the company must continue to innovate and differentiate itself to maintain its market position. The industry is also subject to regulatory and political risks, such as changes in trade policies or data privacy regulations. Additionally, changes in consumer preferences or technology trends could impact the demand for Super Micro\\'s products and services, potentially affecting the company\\'s financial performance.\\nSuper Micro must also remain vigilant in terms of cybersecurity risks, which pose a threat to the entire technology industry. The company has enhanced its cybersecurity measures and implemented robust security protocols to protect its customers\\' data. However, the constantly evolving nature of cybersecurity threats means that the company must remain proactive to ensure that it stays ahead of potential threats.\\nWritten by Jeffrey Neal Johnson\\nRead More…\\nSuper Micro Computer Stock Analysis - MarketRank™\\nSee Top Rated MarketRank™ Stocks\\n93rd Percentile Overall Score\\nSMCI MarketRank™:\\nSuper Micro Computer scored higher than 93% of companies evaluated by MarketBeat, and ranked 81st out of 659 stocks in the computer and technology sector.

But by far, one of the most transformative wallpaper projects I’ve tackled was the backsplash in our ugly California kitchen. Wallpaper is an awesome backsplash alternative to traditional tile (especially for us renters!), but it’s also a fairly tricky installation process thanks to outlets, low-hanging cabinets, appliances, and precise patterns. Today, I’m breaking down exactly how to wallpaper a kitchen backsplash so you feel inspired (and prepared!) to tackle this challenging (but rewarding!) DIY project yourself!\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nBefore & After\\n\\nHere is our kitchen before I added a fun backsplash using peel-and-stick wallpaper. As you can see, I started with a ugly monochromatic and dark blank slate.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd here is how the kitchen looked after the application of a bright white hexagon peel-and-stick wallpaper!\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bright white paper infused some lightness and brightness into the otherwise dreary kitchen. The hexagon design nods to a tile pattern, and the gold lines play off the cabinets just enough to make it all work nicely together.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough adding a crisp white wallpaper to this dreary space was quite the gamble, it ended up being money and time so well spent (as wallpaper almost always is!)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile this transformation was well worth the blood, sweat, and tears, it is definitely one of the tricker wallpapering projects I’ve done…so let me walk you through everything you need to know before you tackle something like this in your own space!\\n\\nUsing Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\n\\nIn a “normal” kitchen, a backsplash is usually created with tile. But there might be lots of reasons you don’t want a tiled backsplash including your budget, your DIY confidence, and (as is our case) the permanence. As renters, we can’t do anything permanent to our homes, so wallpaper is an excellent alternative for adding color, pattern, and style to an otherwise bland kitchen.\\n\\nWhy Not Use Peel-and-Stick Tile?\\n\\nI get asked all the time why I don’t use peel-and-stick tile in our rental kitchens. And my answer is: because it’s not removable!\\n\\nJust because something is peel-and-stick doesn’t mean it comes off easily and mess-free. In my experience, peel-and-stick tile is not a removable product and will destroy the drywall as you peel it off. If you want to add a backsplash that is removable, wallpaper (or vinyl decals like I show here) is going to be your best bet.\\n\\nIf you REALLY want to use peel and stick tile, I came up with a clever hack to keep it renter-friendly and totally removable! See it here:\\xa0How to Install a Peel &#038; Stick Tile Backsplash In a Rental (Without Damage!)\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Type of Wallpaper Is Best for a Backsplash?\\n\\nYou can technically wallpaper a backsplash with any wallpaper (e.g., peel-and-stick, pre-pasted, non-pasted etc). However, since this wallpaper will be in an area that gets wet, moist, and dirty, I do recommend picking a vinyl wallpaper (rather than fabric or textured) that is wipeable (most will indicate so on the packaging).\\n\\nI personally recommending using peel-and-stick wallpaper or heavy-duty contact paper for backsplashes because they are both durable (easy to wipe clean) and removable (it just peels right off!)\\n\\nDoes the Wallpaper Need to Be “Waterproof”?\\n\\nIn my experience, no…at least not for a kitchen. While you may experience some splashing of water or food particles on your wallpapered backsplash, the area will rarely (if ever) get heavily saturated. As such, you will want a wallpaper you can easily wipe clean, but it does not need to be labeled “waterproof” to work well on a backsplash.\\n\\nPicking a Wallpaper Pattern for a Backsplash\\n\\nYou can really pick any wallpaper pattern to put on your backsplash. But if you’re hoping to mimic the look of real tile, keep an eye out for patterns that look like tile! Here are some great examples:\\n\\n\\n\\n1 – Black & White Herringbone | 2 – Grey & Gold Hexagon Paper | 3 – Cream & Neutral Hexagon Paper | 4 – Black Hexagon Wallpaper | 5 – White & Silver Cube Wallpaper | 6 – Blue Medallion Wallpaper | 7 – Black & White Circle Wallpaper | 8 – Grey & White Hexagon Wallpaper | 9 – Faux Brick Wallpaper | 10 – White Subway Tile Wallpaper | 11 – Black Marble Tile Wallpaper | 12 – Long Hexagon Tile Wallpaper | 13 – Marble Herringbone Wallpaper | 14 – Blue Mosaic Tile Wallpaper | 15 – Black & Gold Trellis Wallpaper | 16 – Grey & White Medallion Wallpaper\\n\\nFrom the moment I first saw this photo on the Walls Need Love’s Instagram account, I knew the white and gold hex pattern was perfect for a wallpapered “tile” backsplash for our kitchen!\\n\\nDetermining How Much Wallpaper You Need\\n\\nBefore purchasing your wallpaper, it’s a good idea to accurately measure the space you are wallpapering and devise a plan for how you will use the paper.\\n\\nWhen determining how much paper you need, be sure to take into account:\\n\\nIf the paper you want to use can be easily returned, considering buying extra, because not being able to finish when you run out of paper can be very…very…frustrating.\\n\\n\\n\\nSupplies Needed\\n\\nEvery project will vary slightly; but in general, here are the supplies you will need to wallpaper a backsplash:\\n\\nStep 1: Clear & Clean the Backsplash\\n\\nStart by removing any outlet covers, artwork, or other items covering your backsplash. Wipe down the blank walls of any dust, dirt, debris, grease, oil, or food particles. Let the wall(s) fully dry before applying wallpaper.\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 2: Measure Your Backsplash\\n\\nWallpaper can be expensive, so I highly recommend spending a considerable amount of time planning out exactly how you will apply the paper to your backsplash (and other areas) before you even start cutting and peeling.\\n\\nI mentioned before that wallpapering the backsplash was my trickiest papering job ever, and the picture above shows exactly why. Backsplashes tend to have lots of things that need to be papered around. Outlets are certainly one, but your backsplash might have vents, hoods, shelves, or other items that can’t be removed and need to be considered.\\n\\nTIP! Whenever possible, remove items off the walls/cabinets instead of trying to work around them. Wallpaper is tricky enough to lay flat without anything in the way. I did everything I could to remove the under-cabinet lighting (above) but was unable to do so, which left me having to make tricky cuts around the fixtures.\\n\\nIn order to deal with anything you need to paper around, make a detailed plan of your entire backsplash. As you can see below, I not only detailed out the length and height of each area (to the left of the stove, to the right of the stove, to the right of the window), but I also marked the exact placement of each light and outlet.\\n\\nOn another page (not shown), I dove into even further detail, notating where precisely each light feature was so I could translate those measurements to the wallpaper during the cutting phase (more on that below).\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 3: Plan Your Wallpaper Layout\\n\\nWith the dimensions fully calculated, you can then determine how best to cut your wallpaper.\\n\\nTypically, wallpaper is hung from top to bottom and you work laterally across a space. These days, most paper is printed to be hung vertically, which will make cutting and hanging\\xa0much\\xa0easier.\\n\\nI don’t ever do anything the easy way though. I wanted to use as little wallpaper as possible (because it’s expensive), so I chose to apply the paper horizontally (from left-to-right, rather than top-to-bottom). While this choice certainly added to the complexity of the installation, it did allow me to maximize every inch of paper with very little waste.\\n\\nIn the notebook above (right-hand page), you’ll see I cut each wallpaper strip in half (possible because of the height of my backsplash and the horizontal installation). Instead of a 10′ length of 20″ wide paper (with lots of potential excess thanks to pattern matching), I instead had 20′ of 13″ tall strips that fit the horizontal area above the counter.\\n\\nThis approach may not work for you based on your pattern and orientation preferences, but my point is this: think very carefully about how you can apply the pattern and how you can cut the paper to get the most space covered with as little paper as possible!\\n\\nStep 4: Cut the Wallpaper\\n\\nFiguring out the plan for the wallpaper may very well be your most tedious and time-consuming step. However, once you have all the measurements figured out, you just need to translate them to the wallpaper and get cutting.\\n\\nCut Large Sections First\\n\\nStart by cutting the large rolls down the general sizes determined in your planning. I found it easiest to do large cuts (both length-wise and width-wise) using a rotary cutter and large ruler. Before cutting a particular section, always be sure the patterns line up with the adjoining panels.\\n\\n\\n\\nTIP! I was trying to use up every inch of wallpaper, so I cut my panels down into the exact same measurements as my backsplash. However, if you are able to, try leaving an excess 1-3″ of paper along the top and bottom of each panel so it will perfectly reach the edges of your counters and cabinets no matter how straight (or not) you hang the paper. Then trim away the edges after the paper is on the wall.\\n\\nPre-Cut Details\\n\\nNOTE: If your backsplash area doesn’t have any large or unique features to work around, you can likely skip this step and set right to hanging your larger cuts of paper directly to the wall.\\n\\nWhen papering large expanses of wall, I usually deal with outlets and other features as I’m laying the paper down. However, the backsplash area is such a tight space with so many extra features to work around, that it can be very difficult to get the paper to lie flat without pre-cutting out bulky features.\\n\\nAfter some trial-and-error, I determined it was much easier to cut each feature (the light fixtures) out of the wallpaper before applying it to the wall. To do this, translate the size and placement of any “extra” features (precise size and location measurements are KEY!) to the larger wallpaper strips. In the photo below, you can see the faint lines of the light fixture (along the top) and the outlet (vertical line in the top/middle).\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce you have each feature measured and “drawn,” cut them out using a ruler and very sharp craft knife. This part can feel tedious and a bit scary (slicing big holes in the middle of your wallpaper can be a big risk!) so don’t hesitate to re-measure and double-check as much as necessary!\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 5: Apply the Wallpaper\\n\\nOnce you have all the necessary features cut out of the wallpaper strip, it’s time to apply it! As I mentioned above, I chose to hang my temporary wallpaper horizontally to conserve paper and eliminate excessive match lines on such a small area.\\n\\nNo matter how you are applying your paper (top-to-bottom or side-to-side), peel off just a few inches of the paper backing from the top/side of the wallpaper. Stick that leading edge to the wall, ensuring it is as straight as possible. Then as you work across/down the wall, slowly peel away the paper backing and smooth the paper down with a large paddle scraper.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs you get to edges, outlets, and corners, use a sharp craft knife to make notches as necessary (to relieve paper tension) or trim away extra paper. Once you get the paper in place, use the scraper to really adhere the paper to the wall and work out any wrinkles or bubbles.\\n\\n\\n\\nContinuing hanging your panels, matching up the patterns and working around features, until your entire backsplash area is covered in removable wallpaper!\\n\\nWorking Around Outlets\\n\\nBefore hanging the wallpaper on the wall, I recommend creating a single vertical slit for each outlet (to relieve the paper tension and allow the paper to lay flat on the surrounding wall). Once the paper is fully adhered to the wall, re-visit the outlets to trim away extra paper and ensure it’s laying smooth and flat in every direction. Replace outlet covers only once you’re satisfied with the placement and smoothness of the wallpaper.\\n\\n\\n\\nMore Application Tips & Tricks\\n\\nMy pictures and descriptions make it sound like you just lay the paper down, replace your outlet covers, and walk away. In truth, it will require a lot of placing, peeling off and re-placing; tugging and pulling; sweating; and maybe even crying. Working with peel-and-stick paper CAN be very exasperating, so here are some things to keep in mind:\\n\\nDeciding Where to Stop the Wallpapered Backsplash\\n\\nOne of the trickiest things about backsplashes (tiled, painted, papered, anything!) is deciding where to stop. In some kitchens, there will be doors, trim, appliances, molding, or ends of counter top that make it very clear where the wallpaper installation should end. Other times, it’s not as evident.\\n\\nMy original plan was to only tile the backsplash, and I used the width of our countertop and the height of the cabinets as my guide (as seen below).\\n\\n\\n\\nBut even as I stepped back, put my supplies away, and called the job done, the “tiling” really bothered me. The white paper felt random in the context of the rest of the kitchen; and instead of my eye drifting to the pretty paper, it kept drifting to the ceiling where there was none. Below is a quick snapshot I took as I debated (for weeks!) what to do about it.\\n\\n\\n\\nI finally decided that I needed to extend the wallpaper up the wall to the ceiling in order to make it work. After a quick calculation, I determined I had enough paper leftover to cover the remaining wall (I originally bought enough to “tile” the fireplace in the adjoining family room too).\\n\\n\\n\\nThe wonderful thing about installing wallpaper above cabinets is that there is usually nothing to work around…no outlets, no lights! As such, I just cut the paper into strips and put it right up, matching the pattern as I went around the kitchen.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe lived with just the backsplash area done for about 2 months before I finally did the rest of the wall, and to say the change was dramatic is an understatement. The wallpapered backsplash went from feeling random and disjointed to providing a fun and fresh detail that really woke up the entire kitchen.\\n\\nIf your cabinets do not reach the ceiling or a soffit, I highly recommend wallpapering the area above the cabinets for the most visual impact.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the three years we lived in this house, I was never\\xa0really able to get used to the brown cabinets and brown counters and brown floors. But the small temporary changes I was able to make (like the wallpapered backsplash and this simple window valance) truly helped me like the space a lot more than the dull cave we started with. Although this wallpaper backsplash wasn’t the easiest DIY I’ve taken on, it was certainly one of the most rewarding!\\n\\n\\n\\nOther Renter-Friendly Kitchen Updates\\n\\nWhether you rent or own, I suspect most of us have aspects of our homes we just don’t love. And while a big fancy renovation would be nice, it just might not be in the cards for one reason or another.\\n\\nI hope this wallpaper backsplash tutorial not only shows you a fun and creative way to change up your kitchen, bathroom, laundry, or work space (in a totally temporary way!) but also inspires you that even small, seemingly insignificant or unnecessary changes can help you love the home you’re in just a little bit more!\\n\\n\\n\\nProducts, You May Like\\n\\nFiskars Cutting Set\\n\\nFlexible Measuring Tape\\n\\nCricut XL Scraper\\n\\nCricut TrueControl Knife\\n\\nYou May Also Like\\n\\nDoes Peel and Stick Wallpaper Damage Walls?\\n\\nHow to Install a Peel & Stick Tile Backsplash In a Rental (Without Damage!)\\n\\n12+ Totally Temporary Ways to Update Rental Walls\\n\\nHow to Make a Vinyl Tile Backsplash with a Cricut\\n\\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\\n\\nYour email address will not be published.

It makes such a difference. Here’s another suggestion for you. Chalkboard vinyl on the panels of your cabinet doors. My son-in-law suggested that I paint my doors with the chalkboard paint, but I couldn’t bring myself to do something so permanent. I found the vinyl online though, on some sort of deal, and I LOVE IT. It is fun to label my cabinets, and it would cut way back on the brown in your kitchen. (I think it would coordinate with the black on your fridge and appliances, too.) Anyway, just a suggestion. I love your ideas.\\n\\nLove this!\\n\\nMegan, your info is great – many thanks. Any experience or suggestions for using wallpaper for a backsplash? I want to use nautical maps which are just heavy paper. I would probably need to paint with a clear waterproofing product after it is up. I wallpapered a powder room with National Geographic maps and it turned out fantastic but they don’t get splashed with water and the occasional tomato sauce splatter.  –  Keep up the great work! (Lining drawers with wallpaper is another brillliant idea – thanks)\\n\\nLove the paper design you chose.\\nI’ve always wanted to use peel & stick wallpaper but have heard horror stories of removal. Don’t be surprised if when removing (because your renting) some of the sheetrock paper comes off as well; meaning now you have to texture in a rental.\\nWondering – was has been your experience removing peel & stick after several years?\\nThanks!\\n\\nHi Rob,\\nThanks for sharing your thoughts! Personally, I’ve used peel-and-stick wallpaper over and over and over and have NEVER had it ruin the walls…including the hex paper shown in this post (we pulled it down after it being up for 2+ years).\\xa0\\nI do always test any paper before I do a full installation (often leaving a swatch up for a few weeks to make sure there isn’t any long-term damage). The most I’ve had peel-and-stick paper do is pull little specs of paint off, which are easily touched up.\\xa0\\nI have so much faith in it that I now use it more than paint in all of our rentals…which we usually move out of every 2-3 years.\\nHope that encourages you to give it a try!Megan\\n\\nDid you apply any kind of water proof coating? I’ve heard of that or covering it with glass or plexiglass. Do you think that would be necessary?\\n\\nHi Becky!\\n\\nNo, I don’t think that’s necessary at all. At least not for the paper we used. Most peel-and-stick papers are like a thick contact paper, so they can easily be wiped clean. I would just be sure not to pick a fabric-like wallpaper or one with texture, although even some of those would likely be fine. Wallpaper is much more durable than people think!\\n\\nHope that helps!\\nMegan\\n\\nI love this! Such a great idea. Love your blog! So helpful and great ideas.\\nI can *almost* do this except for having textured walls and living in FL – humidity may make wallpaper not stick to it.\\nWe have a galley kitchen so already no counter space but need something waterproof over the sink. Wall-mounted dish rack is the only way to deal w no counter space.  But you would still see the wallpaper behind it.\\nDo you happen to know of a very affordable product or treatment I can use over wallpaper that is waterproof & washable?\\nThanks!\\n\\nHi Vanessa,\\nFirst – make sure you check on my wallpaper on textured walls post here:\\nSecond, in my experience, I have never had wallpaper fall down, bubble or peel up. And we have lived in North Carolina, Kansas, California and Virginia. That said, I would ALWAYS do a test on any wall and leave it up for a while before you do a full installation.\\nThird, most peel-and-stick wallpapers are wipeable/washable. So if the wallpaper DOES stay up, you’d be able to clean it without any issue. The white wallpaper in this post was wiped down with a wet rag constantly.\\nFinally, if you determine you do need something over the wallpaper, some sort of plexiglass/acrylic sheet could work (although it would be pricey) or you could try clear contact paper.\\xa0\\nHope those thoughts help a bit!Megan\\n\\nYou are so very inspiring!\\n\\nThanks so much…glad you stopped by!\\nMegan\\n\\nAny thoughts on how you would manage an outside corner with wallpaper?\\n\\nHi Shonda!\\nI’m not sure what you mean by outside corner…do you mean one that protrudes outward rather than in?\\nI actually think paper bends easier around a protruding\\xa0corner, but it will still be tricky to keep it perfectly level. I’d give it a try going around the corner first. If you can’t get the follow-on paper to line up level, then you could technically cut it at the corner and start over, but you run the risk of the seam being really visible.\\xa0\\nIf you cut your paper 1-2″ taller than you need, you’d be able to turn the corner and not have any gap between the paper and the upper cabinets, even if it does go a little off as you make the bend.\\nDoes that help?\\nThanks!Megan\\n\\nContent Sidebar\\n\\nHi, I'm Megan!\\n\\nI am a military spouse, mom to 3 young boys, and a constant creator. Thanks to my husband’s career, we have moved 10 times in the last 19 years, and I’ve made it my personal mission to decorate, organize, and re-imagine each rental space until it feels like home.\\n\\nI love navy blue, a good peel-and-stick wallpaper, my Cricut machine, and really hot coffee; and I genuinely believe that…\\n\\n…any space can be transformed into a place that feels like home!\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\nto get new posts delivered to your inbox\\n\\nYou did it!

The instructions for installing a washable wallpaper backsplash are the same, but since the original post, we have updated the backsplash with new wallpaper.\\nAt the end of the DIY, you will see not only how easy this washable backsplash is to install, but also how easy it is to change it when you fancy a new design. There are examples of making waterproof wallpaper splashbacks in the bathroom, plus other wallpaper decorating ideas for the home.\\nIn the UK my friends say the word backsplash, the other way around, splashback. Having been bought up in 2 cultures, I’m happy using the word either way.\\nI know you can get washable vinyl wallpaper, which is sometimes used as a kitchen backsplash, but they are limited in designs. With this method, we use for making a wallpaper kitchen backsplash you can use any wallpaper. It doesn’t have to be waterproof either.\\nDIY Kitchen Wallpaper Backsplash (splashback) with wallpaper\\nMy friend had spotted some gorgeous Dragonfly wallpaper by Harlequin. Even though it wasn’t a wallpaper specially designed for kitchens, she was determined to have it. That’s when we worked out the best way to make a kitchen wallpaper splashback (backsplash).\\nThe wallpaper is protected by a piece of glass and is screwed to the wall. The really awesome thing about this DIY splashback is that it’s really easy to unscrew the glass and change the wallpaper when you feel like something different.\\nYou could even put something other than wallpaper behind the glass, such as a photo collage, or other images printed on paper. I’m a huge fan of decorating and crafting with old maps, so I would be tempted to use an old map for my kitchen backsplash. However, I can see myself getting distracted by the map, instead of concentrating on my cooking.\\n\\nWe’re a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.\\nWhat you need\\n\\nWallpaper – Depending on the size of your kitchen splashback (backsplash) and how your wallpaper pattern fits will determine how much wallpaper you use. Usually, you would need no more than a quarter roll. The wallpaper we used was a Harlequin Wallpaper, Palmetto Demoiselle, which comes in several different colorways, eBay is a great place to look for odd or even part rolls of wallpaper.\\nWallpaper paste/adhesive – I recommend using a wallpaper paste that has anti-fungal properties. You can buy an anti-fungal agent to add the adhesive. This will help stop the wallpaper from going moldy with any kitchen condensation.\\nRotary cutter and mat\\nPlywood base – This will need to be the size of your DIY splashback. We used a 5.5mm hardwood ply.\\nGlass – This again will be the size of your kitchen backsplash. We used a 4mm toughened low iron glass which we got cut to size at the store. We also had 4 screw holes drilled into each corner of the glass at the store. Make sure the glass is heatproof safety glass.\\nDomed mirror screws – 4, one for each corner.\\nTile trim – The size of the trim depends on the thickness of the backsplash. We used a 12mm wrap round trim in chrome. You don’t have to have a trim, it’s mainly about aesthetics. This can be purchased from your local tiling store.\\n\\n\\nHow to make your DIY Splashback\\nStep1: First, carefully measure the exact area of where you would like the kitchen backsplash to be. Ours was a square just above the cooker hob.\\nWe were installing the wallpapered backsplash on a newly fitted kitchen with a freshly plastered and painted blank wall.\\n\\nStep 2. Take these measurements to your local DIY/Home store and get the plywood and glass cut to the size. At the same time get them to drill the screw holes into the corner of the glass.\\n\\nStep 3. Next, carefully think about how your wallpaper pattern design will fit on the backsplash before cutting it to the measurements. With the dragonfly wallpaper design, we wanted whole dragonflies in the middle of the backsplash. Therefore, we ended up with one wallpaper roll width in the middle and two-part widths on either side.\\n\\nStep 4. Next, to make sure that the wallpaper will stick firmly, key your plywood. Do this by coating the cut plywood with a layer of wallpaper paste and leaving it to dry.\\n\\nStep 5. Once the key has dried, paste the board again with wallpaper paste. Then stick the wallpaper sheets down one at a time. Make sure the pattern lines up properly. Use a wallpaper roller to squeeze out any air bubbles. Leave the wallpaper to dry thoroughly.\\n\\nAttaching the backsplash to the wall and making it waterproof\\nStep 6. Next, comes the tricky bit of attaching the plywood and glass to the wall. You will probably need more than one pair of hands for this stage. Attach the plywood and glass to the wall at the same time using the same mirror screws.\\nMeasure where the screw holes will need to be in the wall and then drill the holes and add the appropriate wall plug. Do the same with the wallpapered plywood.\\nThe mirror screws go through the glass and wallpapered plywood and then into the wall at the back. Use a chrome dome cap to finish off the screws.\\nWe used a low iron toughened glass for this splashback, because if it’s not low iron the glass can have a green hue to it.\\n\\n\\nStep 7. Finally, the wallpapered kitchen backsplash has a raw edge, to neaten this up we fitted a chrome tile trim.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow To Change The Wallpaper\\nAfter six years of the dragonfly wallpaper as a backsplash, it was time for a change. The back wall in the kitchen had been wallpapered with a Lucy Tiffney wallpaper and my friend Wendy wanted the backsplash to match.\\n\\nStep 1: The first thing to do was to remove the old backsplash. This only took about 10 minutes. First, the chrome trim was removed from the edges of the glass. They just simply slid out. Next, the four screws were removed from the glass and the glass plate lifted away.\\n\\nStep 2: The plywood back with the dragonfly wallpaper was laid down on the counter. We didn’t bother removing the old wallpaper but just stuck the new design on top of the old. As with the original backsplash, we made sure the pattern matched up. We used the same adhesive and technique as above.\\n\\n\\nStep 3: Once the new wallpaper has dried, screw it all back into the wall with the same glass front as before. Then slide the chrome trim back into place. It’s really that easy and takes less than an hour to change the wallpaper backsplash.\\n\\nFAQs About This DIY and Kitchen\\nWhy glass instead of plexiglass (plastic)?\\nPlexiglass scratches very easily, crazes and is much more difficult to clean well. Also, plexiglass will melt with the heat and collect grease. Glass is more heat-resistant and is easy enough to clean. The cost is about on par with the plexiglass. Make sure you use heatproof safety glass.\\nDo you have to have special heat resistant glass?\\nIt was safety glass and a low iron glass to avoid a green tint.\\nWhere did you get the glass and how much did it cost for a piece that large?\\nIt was from a local builders merchant in the UK and cost about £100 ($140), which included the pre-drilled holes.\\nHow has it held up to the heat from the stove?\\nThe wallpaper has been up for almost five years now and it still looks as good as the day it was installed. The stove has seen a lot of heavy cooking in that time. The glass is actually very easy to keep clean and has protected the wallpaper well.\\nWhat do you have on the countertops?\\nThey are oiled beechwood countertops.\\nIs that a TV/ Mirror above the cooker?\\nNo, it is actually the cooker hood and extractor fan.\\nWhere is your refrigerator?\\nThe fridge is integrated into the design of the kitchen. It is behind one of the cupboard doors, at the back of the kitchen.\\nWhere’s the apartment? Looks like a studio?\\nIt’s actually a Victorian terrace house and the view is looking in from the back yard.\\nI love the gas cooktop what is the brand?\\nIt’s a Smeg cooker hob I got it in the UK.\\nWould you tell us what your flooring is? Love the colour and the herringbone pattern?\\nIt’s a vinyl plank flooring from a company called Project Floors in the UK. The vinyl looks like wood, but it is more water and temperature-resistant. Which makes it better suited for kitchens and bathrooms than real wood.\\n\\nOther Options\\nI think the wallpaper kitchen backsplash looks awesome in Wendy’s kitchen. With so many fantastic wallpaper designs available, you will easily find something that would look amazing in your kitchen. I know that when I eventually get a new kitchen, I will have a DIY wallpaper splashback. I also love the fact that it’s easy to change when you fancy something different.\\nAfter the success of this DIY wallpaper splashback, we decided to add one to the bathroom. This one was above the bathroom sink. The wallpaper chosen for this design was a Mid-century modern design by Orla Kiely.\\nThe kitchen bin in the picture above was upcycled with an Orla Kiely wallpaper. The tutorial for that bin upcycle and more brilliant wallpaper upcycles are here. There is a tutorial for the table decoupaged with wallpaper here.\\n\\nI have used wallpaper in many more places around the home as well as the kitchen. I’ve even wallpapered my stairs with another Mid-Century modern design, this one by Marimekko. I’ve made many wallpapered lampshades to match the decor in my home and I have also updated mirrors with wallpaper.\\nKeep any wallpaper scraps leftover from this DIY, there are many things you can craft with them including making pretty paper vases.\\nFor other practical kitchen DIYs check out my post on how to paint kitchen wooden countertops.

While last year didn\\'t entirely snuff out quiet luxury, it put us on a pendulum swing in the opposite direction—and in a fever-pitch pursuit of personal style.\\nWe craved individuality in our closets and wanted items that championed it. Barn jackets—both Carhartt\\'s $90 canvas classics and Prada\\'s $4,000 purposely worn workwear coats—became a way to escape regular life and role-play as a hay-baler in the English countryside. Bubble skirts brought frothy, coquettish cuteness, and Charli XCX\\'s brat green was a provocative sucker punch.\\nEven the items that still whispered \"stealth wealth\" had something more interesting to say than \"if you know, you know\". For instance, the suede bag trend that was everywhere last fall (see Coach\\'s viral Brooklyn) was a harbinger of a bigger boho-chic comeback.\\nWhile it\\'s impossible to know exactly what we\\'ll wear over the coming 12 months, we can make some good educated guesses. Here, Marie Claire draws inspiration from the Spring 2025 trends unveiled on last September\\'s runways and consults fashion experts and analysts to uncover what’s next for fashion in 2025.\\nSea La Vie\\nWhen it comes to the products Marie Claire recommends, we take your faith in us seriously. Every product that we feature comes recommended by a MC writer or editor, or by an expert we\\'ve spoken to.

The Vogue alum points to Miu Miu\\'s Spring 2025 show, where models sported intentionally chipped, flaky nails, as well as Gucci and Bottega\\'s paparazzi-style campaigns and Balenciaga\\'s iPhone-shot ads—complete with a finger smudge on the lens.\\nWhat does the \"realification of fashion\" mean for the clothes we’ll actually wear? \"Think softer fabrics, relaxed silhouettes, and a redefinition of sexiness. It’s no longer about trussing ourselves into clothes that make us feel alien or uncomfortable,\" says Rachel Solomon, author of the style Substack Hey, Mrs. Solomon. Instead, it\\'s a mindset shift toward \"investing in pieces we genuinely wear, rather than splurging on items for an imagined lifestyle,\" she explains.\\n\\nBarbour Beatrix Longline Trench Coat\\n$440 at Saks Fifth Avenue\\n\\nToteme Gathered Stretch-Jersey Midi Dress\\n$690 at Net-a-Porter\\n\\nTory Burch Apron Toe Loafers\\n$298 at Bloomingdale\\'s\\nBoho 2.0\\n\\nThe boho boom, as evidenced by Balenciaga\\'s Le City Bag relaunch, Isabel Marant, Chloe, and Ralph Lauren\\'s Spring 2025 shows.\\n(Image credit: Future)\\nLike a rolling stone, bohemian fashion keeps on keeping on.\\n\"For 2025, boho chic makes a polished comeback, moving beyond last season’s rugged vintage vibe,\" says Voyer. \"This season emphasizes romantic, feminine silhouettes that feel effortless yet intentional.\" She highlights Chemena Kamal\\'s fresh, modern approach at Chloé and Gen Z’s knack for vintage shopping as key factors breathing new life into the aesthetic. Stanback agrees: \"Gen Z embraces nostalgia, reviving and reinterpreting historical trends they never experienced firsthand.\"\\nWhen it comes to shopping, Stanback points to Balenciaga’s re-released cult-favorite Le City Bag, along with lace, tulle, ruffles, and shimmer. Meanwhile, Voyer highlights suede jackets, wide-leg jeans, and flowing maxi skirts and dresses as key pieces.\\n\\nDôen Rhodia Floral Cotton Midi-Dress\\n$240 at Saks Fifth Avenue\\n\\nMadewell The Essential Curve Shoulder Bag\\n$198 at Madewell\\n\\nVeronica Beard Jean Dylan High Rise Straight Leg Jeans\\n$328 at Shopbop\\nMeaningful Minimalism\\n\\nBurberry, Dries Van Noten, Carven, The Row, and Ferragamo focus on the essentials for 2025.\\n(Image credit: Future)\\nIn response to “quiet luxury, the ‘clean girl’ aesthetic, and monotonous design, there\\'s a growing desire for more thoughtful curation and a return to meaningful minimalism,” says Hallie Spradlin, director of visionary at the trend forecasting company Fashion Snoops. She notes this shift is reflected in \"extra-special details that redefine luxury through unique touches and added flair,\" like incorporating statement pieces into everyday wear or investing in standout items like the season’s best cargo pants. \"Ultimately, the power lies in thoughtful, functional, or playful details that elevate the overall experience of a piece.\"\\nJoanne Thomas, Fashion Snoops’ director of color, highlights the rise of \"superimposed pastels\" in 2025. She describes \"blues that exude quiet charm and bouncy mints with a fizzy freshness that invigorates the senses.\" These hues provide a playful yet calming escape from the everyday. In contrast, she notes, \"a unique blend of grey and beige will ground the year in simplicity and stability.\"\\n\\nGuest in Residence Cloud Wool-Blend Crewneck Sweater\\n$395 at Saks Fifth Avenue\\n\\nPrada Eternal Gold Bow Signet Ring - Yellow Gold\\n$2,800 at Prada\\n\\nBaserange Blue Dydine Maxi Skirt\\n$165 at SSENSE\\nPower Rewired\\n\\nNeo-power pieces in Paris Fashion Week street style and on Tory Burch, Brandon Maxwell, Coach, and Paco Rabanne\\'s runways.\\n(Image credit: Future)\\nThis year will also demonstrate Gen Z\\'s prowess as taste-makers. Voyer predicts Zoomers will \"redefine power dressing and officewear with a rebellious flair. Think rock and grunge influences fused with vintage luxury pieces, sportswear, and streetwear, much like the Spring 205 collections of Coach, Prada, Rabanne, and Willy Chavarria. This bold fusion of eras and styles sets the stage for a year of self-expression and redefined fashion codes in what Voyer calls a \\'power rewired\\' aesthetic.

Here’s how it works.\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\nBy Emma Childs\\npublished 9 January 2025\\nin Buying Guides\\nGrasping the 2025 fashion trends starts with reflecting on 2024\\'s. While last year didn\\'t entirely snuff out quiet luxury, it put us on a pendulum swing in the opposite direction—and in a fever-pitch pursuit of personal style.\\nWe craved individuality in our closets and wanted items that championed it. Barn jackets—both Carhartt\\'s $90 canvas classics and Prada\\'s $4,000 purposely worn workwear coats—became a way to escape regular life and role-play as a hay-baler in the English countryside. Bubble skirts brought frothy, coquettish cuteness, and Charli XCX\\'s brat green was a provocative sucker punch.\\nEven the items that still whispered \"stealth wealth\" had something more interesting to say than \"if you know, you know\". For instance, the suede bag trend that was everywhere last fall (see Coach\\'s viral Brooklyn) was a harbinger of a bigger boho-chic comeback.\\nWhile it\\'s impossible to know exactly what we\\'ll wear over the coming 12 months, we can make some good educated guesses. Here, Marie Claire draws inspiration from the Spring 2025 trends unveiled on last September\\'s runways and consults fashion experts and analysts to uncover what’s next for fashion in 2025.\\nSea La Vie\\nWhen it comes to the products Marie Claire recommends, we take your faith in us seriously. Every product that we feature comes recommended by a MC writer or editor, or by an expert we\\'ve spoken to. Learn more about how we review products.\\n\\nJW Anderson, Loewe, Aläia, Miu Miu, and Proenza Schouler all prepped their sea legs for 2025.\\n(Image credit: Future)\\nIn 2025, expect to dive into aquatic-inspired fashion, predicts Noémie Voyer, fashion lead at trend analytics platform Heuritech. “During Spring 2025 Fashion Week, we saw silhouettes channeling the popular ‘mermaid-core’ aesthetic—think glamour, sequins, and fishtail skirts—paired with sporty elements like Alaïa’s fishnet jogger pants, sexy scuba-inspired looks from Miu Miu, and one-piece swimsuits worn as bodysuits at Tory Burch and Miu Miu,” she explains.\\nNautical influences will also make waves. “Picture coastal prep with a kitschy twist—marinière stripes, loose-fitting pieces, and a focus on comfort and fluidity,” says Sydney Stanback, who leads Pinterest\\'s global trends and insights. \"Expect a resurgence of cable-knit sweaters, Breton-striped tops, and even fish-shaped bags, which are already up 50 percent in searches compared to last year.\" She also highlights thick cuff-hem denim, pea coats, and boat-neck sweaters as must-have items to shop now.\\n\\nJ.Crew Ribbed Cotton Button-Collar Sweater in Stripe\\n$50 at J.Crew\\n\\nLevi\\'s 501 90s Cuff Straight\\n$141 at Revolve\\n\\nAlaïa Fishnet Ballerina Flat\\n$890 at Nordstrom\\nSlice of Life Style\\n\\nBalenciaga\\'s Pre-Fall 2025 campaign, Miu Miu, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent, and Prada\\'s Spring 2025 shows all kept it real.\\n(Image credit: Future)\\nThe reality is that most people are back to their 9-to-5 office routines, and our wardrobes are poised to reflect this shift toward practicality even more. \"Reality dressing is here for 2025,\" says Liana Satenstein, the fashion newscaster behind the Instagram Live series and Substack Never Worn.\\n\"We\\'re done with the rabid cores and voracious consumption of clothes to show off on the internet [for clout],\" says Satenstein. The Vogue alum points to Miu Miu\\'s Spring 2025 show, where models sported intentionally chipped, flaky nails, as well as Gucci and Bottega\\'s paparazzi-style campaigns and Balenciaga\\'s iPhone-shot ads—complete with a finger smudge on the lens.\\nWhat does the \"realification of fashion\" mean for the clothes we’ll actually wear? \"Think softer fabrics, relaxed silhouettes, and a redefinition of sexiness. It’s no longer about trussing ourselves into clothes that make us feel alien or uncomfortable,\" says Rachel Solomon, author of the style Substack Hey, Mrs. Solomon. Instead, it\\'s a mindset shift toward \"investing in pieces we genuinely wear, rather than splurging on items for an imagined lifestyle,\" she explains.\\n\\nBarbour Beatrix Longline Trench Coat\\n$440 at Saks Fifth Avenue\\n\\nToteme Gathered Stretch-Jersey Midi Dress\\n$690 at Net-a-Porter\\n\\nTory Burch Apron Toe Loafers\\n$298 at Bloomingdale\\'s\\nBoho 2.0\\n\\nThe boho boom, as evidenced by Balenciaga\\'s Le City Bag relaunch, Isabel Marant, Chloe, and Ralph Lauren\\'s Spring 2025 shows.\\n(Image credit: Future)\\nLike a rolling stone, bohemian fashion keeps on keeping on.\\n\"For 2025, boho chic makes a polished comeback, moving beyond last season’s rugged vintage vibe,\" says Voyer. \"This season emphasizes romantic, feminine silhouettes that feel effortless yet intentional.\" She highlights Chemena Kamal\\'s fresh, modern approach at Chloé and Gen Z’s knack for vintage shopping as key factors breathing new life into the aesthetic. Stanback agrees: \"Gen Z embraces nostalgia, reviving and reinterpreting historical trends they never experienced firsthand.\"\\nWhen it comes to shopping, Stanback points to Balenciaga’s re-released cult-favorite Le City Bag, along with lace, tulle, ruffles, and shimmer. Meanwhile, Voyer highlights suede jackets, wide-leg jeans, and flowing maxi skirts and dresses as key pieces.\\n\\nDôen Rhodia Floral Cotton Midi-Dress\\n$240 at Saks Fifth Avenue\\n\\nMadewell The Essential Curve Shoulder Bag\\n$198 at Madewell\\n\\nVeronica Beard Jean Dylan High Rise Straight Leg Jeans\\n$328 at Shopbop\\nMeaningful Minimalism\\n\\nBurberry, Dries Van Noten, Carven, The Row, and Ferragamo focus on the essentials for 2025.\\n(Image credit: Future)\\nIn response to “quiet luxury, the ‘clean girl’ aesthetic, and monotonous design, there\\'s a growing desire for more thoughtful curation and a return to meaningful minimalism,” says Hallie Spradlin, director of visionary at the trend forecasting company Fashion Snoops. She notes this shift is reflected in \"extra-special details that redefine luxury through unique touches and added flair,\" like incorporating statement pieces into everyday wear or investing in standout items like the season’s best cargo pants. \"Ultimately, the power lies in thoughtful, functional, or playful details that elevate the overall experience of a piece.\"\\nJoanne Thomas, Fashion Snoops’ director of color, highlights the rise of \"superimposed pastels\" in 2025. She describes \"blues that exude quiet charm and bouncy mints with a fizzy freshness that invigorates the senses.\" These hues provide a playful yet calming escape from the everyday. In contrast, she notes, \"a unique blend of grey and beige will ground the year in simplicity and stability.\"\\n\\nGuest in Residence Cloud Wool-Blend Crewneck Sweater\\n$395 at Saks Fifth Avenue\\n\\nPrada Eternal Gold Bow Signet Ring - Yellow Gold\\n$2,800 at Prada\\n\\nBaserange Blue Dydine Maxi Skirt\\n$165 at SSENSE\\nPower Rewired\\n\\nNeo-power pieces in Paris Fashion Week street style and on Tory Burch, Brandon Maxwell, Coach, and Paco Rabanne\\'s runways.\\n(Image credit: Future)\\nThis year will also demonstrate Gen Z\\'s prowess as taste-makers. Voyer predicts Zoomers will \"redefine power dressing and officewear with a rebellious flair. Think rock and grunge influences fused with vintage luxury pieces, sportswear, and streetwear, much like the Spring 205 collections of Coach, Prada, Rabanne, and Willy Chavarria. This bold fusion of eras and styles sets the stage for a year of self-expression and redefined fashion codes in what Voyer calls a \\'power rewired\\' aesthetic. Key pieces include baggy jeans, front-crease tailored trousers, hourglass blazers, and hot pants.\\n\\nAgolde Low Slung Baggy Jeans\\n$160 at Nordstrom\\n\\nBabaton Standout Blazer\\n$248 at Aritzia\\n\\nFavorite Daughter The Favorite Pant\\n$228 at Revolve\\nGood Bad Taste\\n\\nExpressive fashion peacocking shown in Copenhagen and Paris Fashion Week\\'s street style and Loewe, Dries Van Noten, Prada, and Saint Laurent\\'s Spring 2025 shows.\\n(Image credit: Future)\\nNoora Raj Brown, executive vice president at Goop and author of the shopping Substack Objects of Desire, predicts \"a shift away from years of minimalism and muted tones toward unbridled expressions of personal taste.

Ahead are the defining spring 2025 fashion trends to wear and shop this season.\\n01 of 06\\nC-Suite Dressing\\n\\nGetty Images\\nThe power suit is getting a new life this season. Brands like Stella McCartney, Saint Laurent, and Victoria Beckham proposed fresh iterations of this classic staple via voluminous cut-outs, open-neck blazers, and strong-shouldered iterations. Evidently, these new suits are no walk in the boardroom, though, giving a relaxed, almost casual feel to the otherwise buttoned-up staple.\\n02 of 06\\nChecked Out\\n\\nGetty Images\\nPlaid for spring? That is groundbreaking. The countryside-approved print was made anew for spring on the runways of Acne, Ralph Lauren, and Bottega Veneta. Although this may feel familiar, it\\'s certainly no \"been there, done that\" trend. Ditch your plaid button-down for voluminous skirts, barrel-sleeved jackets, and mixed-material frocks that defy the plaid we\\'ve always known.\\nLook of the day\\n\\n\\n\\nMust see fits from all your favorite celebs.\\nSee the looks\\n03 of 06\\nDancing Girl Emoji\\n\\nGetty Images\\nDancing through life is not just a Wicked masterpiece.

Ahead are the defining spring 2025 fashion trends to wear and shop this season.\\n01 of 06\\nC-Suite Dressing\\n\\nGetty Images\\nThe power suit is getting a new life this season. Brands like Stella McCartney, Saint Laurent, and Victoria Beckham proposed fresh iterations of this classic staple via voluminous cut-outs, open-neck blazers, and strong-shouldered iterations. Evidently, these new suits are no walk in the boardroom, though, giving a relaxed, almost casual feel to the otherwise buttoned-up staple.\\n02 of 06\\nChecked Out\\n\\nGetty Images\\nPlaid for spring? That is groundbreaking. The countryside-approved print was made anew for spring on the runways of Acne, Ralph Lauren, and Bottega Veneta. Although this may feel familiar, it\\'s certainly no \"been there, done that\" trend.

And key themes can already be incorporated into your wardrobe.\\nConsider spring’s outerwear stories, which reimagine lightweight jackets of all types, particularly sporty styles for the season ahead. For inspiration on how to wear these jackets from now, look no further than Bottega, where an elasticated windbreaker was styled with fluid trousers. A zip-up à la Gucci works equally well here—just throw an overcoat on top. Suede will continue to trend as well, so if you invested this fall, keep wearing it! At Prada, caramel suede was paired with dark grey—a new go-to winter color combo to try in the new year.\\nSpeaking of the new year, it’s the perfect opportunity to refresh your work staples. For the office and beyond, we’ll be seeing new takes on tailoring—both oversized and shrunken—to suit your 2025 style resolutions. There are plenty of relaxed suiting options to add to your rotation right now—make it full look for that inimitable Saint Laurent swagger.\\nAs for the print that reigned supreme on the spring/summer runways? It wasn’t a floral or an animal but plaid. The autumnal pattern was already a favorite this fall, but it seems like fashion wasn’t done with it for spring, rendering it in softer colors and shapes. If plaid was already a trend you incorporated this season, look to the runways for ideas on how to print clash—we saw it styled as full ensembles in various checks, but also contrasted with polkadots and stripes.\\nBelow, a look at the three key spring/summer 2025 fashion trends you can wear now—a running list we’ll continue to update as spring’s coveted deliveries land in stores.\\nRunway: Loewe Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025; Prada Spring 2025; Miu Miu Spring 2025; Gucci Spring 2025\\nPhotos: Courtesy of GoRunway.com\\nSpring Outerwear Stories\\nA sporty sensibility carried over from fashion’s Olympics fervor pervaded the spring/summer 2025 runways.

A cropped leather cape made an appearance at Loewe, upleveling the boho staple we were reacquainted with last spring.

Borelli-Persson described these checks best as “Nirvana meets Country Living… for any season or type of weather” in her trend report. The Row’s ‘Tavishina’ coat in look 29 exemplifies the fashion mood, with an energizing combination of beige, black, and baby blue squares that was styled with pinstripe pants and a plain white button-up for a harmonious, minimalist-approved take on print mixing. Blazy meanwhile played with a classic color scheme of browns, greys, and white, but showed it as an oversized shacket meets coat hybrid. At Tod’s checks were playfully introduced once more, worn inside out as a full ensemble. In New York, Daniella Kallmeyer furthered the artful drape with a fluid blouse, while Acne Studios dabbled in the art of the clash (nails included!) and incorporated another theme seen in the resort 2025 trends: the bubble hem. This ’90s-inspired look can be achieved now with printed pieces from the likes of Massimo Dutti, Ralph Lauren, or Zara—and styled with pattern opposites for a true runway-coded look.\\n\\nBottega Veneta\\nchecked cotton trench coat\\n$3,900BOTTEGA VENETA\\n\\nDries Van Noten\\ngathered checked crepe maxi dress\\n$2,110NET-A-PORTER\\n\\nRalph Lauren\\nplaid cotton twill workshirt\\n$168RALPH LAUREN\\n\\nMassimo Dutti\\ndraped neck check shirt\\n$120MASSIMO DUTTI\\n\\nAcne Studios\\nsingle-breasted coat\\n$2,150MYTHERESA\\n$2,150SSENSE\\n\\nZara\\nplaid flannel shirt\\n$46ZARA\\nRunway: Tory Burch Spring 2025; Stella McCartney Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025; Saint Laurent Spring 2025; Bally Spring 2025\\nPhotos: Courtesy of GoRunway.com\\nNew Business Codes\\nWe’re leaving the office siren behind for spring, and embracing new tailoring codes for 2025.

In New York, Daniella Kallmeyer furthered the artful drape with a fluid blouse, while Acne Studios dabbled in the art of the clash (nails included!) and incorporated another theme seen in the resort 2025 trends: the bubble hem. This ’90s-inspired look can be achieved now with printed pieces from the likes of Massimo Dutti, Ralph Lauren, or Zara—and styled with pattern opposites for a true runway-coded look.\\n\\nBottega Veneta\\nchecked cotton trench coat\\n$3,900BOTTEGA VENETA\\n\\nDries Van Noten\\ngathered checked crepe maxi dress\\n$2,110NET-A-PORTER\\n\\nRalph Lauren\\nplaid cotton twill workshirt\\n$168RALPH LAUREN\\n\\nMassimo Dutti\\ndraped neck check shirt\\n$120MASSIMO DUTTI\\n\\nAcne Studios\\nsingle-breasted coat\\n$2,150MYTHERESA\\n$2,150SSENSE\\n\\nZara\\nplaid flannel shirt\\n$46ZARA\\nRunway: Tory Burch Spring 2025; Stella McCartney Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025; Saint Laurent Spring 2025; Bally Spring 2025\\nPhotos: Courtesy of GoRunway.com\\nNew Business Codes\\nWe’re leaving the office siren behind for spring, and embracing new tailoring codes for 2025. Simone Bellotti suggested a nipped in peplum shape with drop shoulders at Bally, Stella McCartney went ’80s oversize, Tory Burch introduced a collarless, belted, and wrapped silhouette, and Blazy showed an almost cartoonishly oversize take at Bottega. A happy medium can be found at Saint Laurent, where the many full suiting looks in the collection were inspired by the house founder, and meant to convey “control and power,” as designer Anthony Vaccarello told Vogue’s Mark Holgate post-show backstage.

Here’s how it works.\\n\\n(Image credit: @stephaniebroek; @hannamw; Launchmetrics Spotlight; Backgrid; Courtesy of The New Arrivals: Ilkyaz Ozel; Gilbert Carrasquillo/GC Images/Getty Images)\\nBy Eliza Huber\\npublished 17 December 2024\\nin Features\\nExactly 377 days ago, I wrote the 2024 version of this exact story and started by discussing the ever-changing fashion environment throughout the year prior. Back then, I was excited about the possibilities surrounding some of the industry\\'s more recent creative-director hires—including designers Matthieu Blazy at Bottega Veneta (Blazy started in 2020) and Louise Trotter at Carven. (Trotter started in 2023.) Changes were happening at major houses, new legacies were being built, and excitement was in the air. Little did I know then that 2024 would bring about even more variation. Just last week, Trotter announced her departure from Carven, followed by Blazy at Bottega Veneta. The Italian leather goods brand then named Trotter as Blazy\\'s successor. A few hours later, Chanel answered every fashion person\\'s most burning question: Who will take over from Virginie Viard? The answer was Blazy. That\\'s only two of the industry\\'s many swapped seats this year.\\nSuffice it to say, 2025 is on track to blow 2024\\'s chaotic and unpredictable energy out of the water, but that doesn\\'t mean we must go into the year completely blind. After studying the spring/summer 2025 runway collections and end-of-year culture shifts, I feel confident about my predictions about what\\'s to come in the next 365 days or so. Below, read up on 2025 fashion before the year even begins, from 180-degree aesthetic changes to fresh color trends.\\n\\n(Image credit: TheStewartofNY/GC Images/Getty Images; @hoskelsa; Launchmetrics Spotlight; @fannyekstrand; MEGA/GC Images/Getty Images)\\nThough this trend has been slowly creeping up for a few seasons now, Saint Laurent\\'s S/S 25 collection really put it on the map. We\\'re calling it a few different things, including soft power and power play, but generally speaking, it\\'s fashion\\'s move toward a softer version of workwear that isn\\'t as sharp and tailored as it\\'s been in the past. Suits are slightly more relaxed and oversize and styled personally with cuff bracelets, oversize sunglasses, and interesting outerwear. The trend extended to Bottega Veneta, Stella McCartney, and Christopher Esber. In a press release following Louis Vuitton\\'s show during Paris Fashion Week, the house\\'s creative director Nicolas Ghesquière called soft power the ultimate oxymoron given that softness and power are often seen as opposites. However, where they meet is really where successful women reside. They\\'re multifaceted beings who are able to balance the two contrasting concepts naturally.\\nGoing into 2025, expect this new corporate aesthetic to hit the streets more and more. We\\'ve already seen Saint Laurent\\'s versions on Hailey Bieber and Rosé, but there will, no doubt, be unique takes hitting our social media feeds everywhere very soon. To help you out, here\\'s a tutorial on how to tie a tie. You\\'ll need it.\\n\\nZARA\\nStriped Silk-Viscose Tie\\n$46\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nZARA\\n100% Wool Jacket\\n$139\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nMiu Miu\\nRegard Sunglasses\\n$505\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\n(Image credit: John Nacion/Getty Images; Taylor Hill/WireImage; Gilbert Carrasquillo/GC Images/Getty Images; Courtesy of Prada; Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic/Getty Images; Gilbert Carrasquillo/GC Images/Getty Images; Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images)\\nI recently attended the Shark Beauty Women\\'s Champions Classic, a two-game NCAA basketball event at Barclays Center, and the turnout for the second game of the night between the University of Connecticut (UConn) Huskies and the University of Louisville Cardinals was unlike anything I\\'ve ever seen. The place was packed, especially with women and girls, many of whom wore one specific T-shirt (unless they were wearing merch for UConn star player and Nike athlete Paige Bueckers) by the brand Togethxr. The tee is simple with four words printed on the front in all caps: Everyone watches women\\'s sports.\\nThat T-shirt says it all. According to a report published this month by Morning Consult, an American intelligence company, the WNBA was 2024\\'s fastest-growing brand among all U.S. adults. It was the first time since the company was founded in 2014 that a sports league ranked first on this list. According to StubHub, ticket sales were up nearly 10 times in 2024 compared to 2023 before the season even began. \"This year\\'s NCAA Women\\'s Final Four and the WNBA Finals were the best-selling in StubHub history,\" the company published in a recent report. But it\\'s not just women\\'s basketball that\\'s on an upward trajectory.\\nFollowing the Paris Olympics, which saw 28 out of 32 sports be fully gender equal, female medalists like Suni Lee, Tara Davis-Woodhall, and Ilona Maher were ubiquitous, particularly at fashion events. At the tail end of 2024, female athletes were spotted front row at New York Fashion Week; on the red carpet at the CFDA Awards, GQ Men of the Year event, and Victoria\\'s Secret Fashion Show; and courtside at sporting events decked out in stylish designer garb. Clearly, fashion has noticed the impact women are having on sports and those who view them, and brands, from Prada to Tory Burch, are getting involved in the action.\\n\\ntogethxr\\nWomen\\'s Sports Tee\\n$45\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nadidas x Wales Bonner\\nSamba Croco Sneakers\\n$250\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nPrada\\nLeather Bomber Jacket\\n$8800\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\n(Image credit: @sofiagrainge; @fannyekstrand; Launchmetrics Spotlight; Courtesy of The New Arrivals: Ilkyaz Ozel; @elizagracehuber; @annabelrosendahl)\\nRemember when quiet luxury swept the fashion world and had everyone parting ways with anything in their wardrobe resembling bright colors and vibrant patterns? Same. Well, if you were one of the smart few who put those items in storage instead of sending them away to be donated or sold, give yourself a pat on the back. Come 2025, those are the exact pieces you\\'ll want to grab.\\nOn the spring/summer 2025 runways, a far louder and more extravagant aesthetic made the rounds, appearing most prominently at Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen, Dolce & Gabbana, and Schiaparelli. Chanel\\'s recent Pre-Fall 25 collection took a similar approach, showcasing metallic gold from head to toe, feathers, supple satin, and lots of jewelry. All in all, the runways proved that excess, glamour, and opulence will reign in the year ahead. According to the Instagram account @databutmakeitfashion, Google Search data agrees, showing that the popularity of quiet luxury fashion steadily decreased by 25% in November 2024. Ready your animal prints and lobe-drooping earrings—it\\'s time for your outfits to scream wealth, not whisper it.\\n\\nBy Malene Birger\\nRowani Jacket\\n$3300\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nschiaparelli\\nMouth and Eye Earrings\\n$1939\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nTory Burch\\nWool Skirt\\n$998$699\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\n(Image credit: @hannamw; Rosdiana Ciaravolo/Getty Images; Christian Vierig/Getty Images; Backgrid; Robert Okine/Getty Images for Lionsgate; Launchmetrics Spotlight; @himichelleli)\\nAnother change I\\'m expecting to see in 2025 following the decline in popularity of quiet luxury is an uptick in weight put on personal style. This was very much apparent on the spring/summer 2025 runways, with Miuccia Prada (and Raf Simons) leading the way at Miu Miu and Prada. At the shows in Paris and Milan respectively, models walked in vastly different looks from the person prior, and no one aesthetic or trend stood out. \"Humanity can be defined by its unpredictability, a rejection of the derivative and expected,\" a press release for Prada\\'s show stated. \"A sequence of concurrent realities are here dedications to the individual, every look a unique reflection of their present.\"\\nThis shift away from uniformity wasn\\'t only seen on the runways. In terms of street style, fashion people who\\'ve become known for their unique tastes and abilities to put together ensembles that are identifiable and precisely their own are being spotlighted and rewarded more and more. Think Jenny Walton, Vogue senior fashion editor Naomi Elizée, Neiman Marcus\\'s fashion market and editorial director Chloe King, and stylist and editor Michelle Li. In other words, it\\'s worth it to do some self-exploration and figure out what you like to wear and what feels like you ahead of the New Year.\\n\\nmains de vapeur\\nCoeur Beanie\\n$395\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nMiu Miu\\nLeather Keychain Trick\\n$625\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nJW Anderson\\nHedgehog Clutch\\n$890\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\n(Image credit: @nlmarilyn; @rikkekrefting; @stephaniebroek; @elizagracehuber; Launchmetrics Spotlight; Claudio Lavenia/Getty Images)\\nIf I\\'ve learned anything from fashion this year, it\\'s the importance of investing in long-lasting, timeless pieces—a lesson I\\'m planning to put into effect throughout 2025. No more purchasing items on a whim. Everything I buy next year, or at least most things, need to fulfill my goal of building a collection of future heirlooms. I want things that I can pass down to loved ones that, no matter what, will never go out of style. When I look around the fashion world, it\\'s easy to see that others are shopping with a similar mindset. Luxury watches like Bulgari\\'s Serpenti and Cartier\\'s Baignoire are on the rise, both of which will likely go up in value over time and continue to be standout accessories for decades to come. Newer pieces like the not-yet-named Derby-like Hermès bag, Alaïa\\'s Le Teckel clutch, Chanel\\'s patent-leather moccasins, and Balenciaga\\'s Rodeo bag also come to mind when I think of this anti-trend shift. Sure, they\\'ll be everywhere in 2025, but when the year ends, you\\'ll still very much want and wear them, making them worth spending on.\\n\\nAlaïa\\nLe Teckel Clutch\\n$2350\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nBulgari\\nSerpenti Tubogas Watch\\n$12400\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nDior\\n30\\xa0Montaigne Bar Jacket\\n$5000\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\n(Image credit: Courtesy of Dries Van Noten; Victor Virgile/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images; Joe Maher/Getty Images; Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images; Estrop/Getty Images; Franco Origlia/Getty Images)\\nBlazy and Trotter were far from the only designers to say goodbye to their previous fashion roles and hello to new ones in the last year. In March, Dries Van Noten announced he would be stepping down from the helm of his namesake brand. His successor, Julian Klausner, was announced in early December. In July, less than a year after he took the job, Peter Hawkings exited his role as creative director at Tom Ford. Two months later, Haider Ackermann was appointed to the position. \"He is an incredible colorist, his tailoring is sharp, and above all, he is modern,\" said Ford of the appointment in a press release. On September 29, we saw Alessandro Michele present his first runway collection for Valentino. (The French house announced his hiring in March 2024.) Of course, we have the confirmed news of Blazy\\'s and Trotter\\'s new positions too, but that\\'s not all. There are also rumors swirling around fashion circles and the internet about Jonathan Anderson, Loewe\\'s creative director since 2013 and the founder of London brand JW Anderson. Will he leave Loewe? Is he headed to Dior? Unlike all of the other aforementioned shifts, this is one piece of information with zero confirmation. I guess we\\'ll have to wait until 2025 to see.\\n\\nBottega Veneta\\nAndiamo Clutch\\n$2950\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nCARVEN\\nScarf Voile Blouse\\n$1290\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nCHANEL\\nSlingbacks\\n$1225\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\n(Image credit: @jilla.tequila; Samir Hussein/WireImage/Getty Images; Launchmetrics Spotlight; Steve Granitz/FilmMagic/Getty Images; @hoskelsa; @elizagracehuber)\\nIf 2024 was all about red, from traditional to burgundy, 2025 will be centered on pale pink, and it\\'s not just because it\\'s Glinda Upland\\'s favorite color.

Pink's return to fashion fame after a brief hiatus following Barbie came about thanks to brands like Alaïa, Brandon Maxwell, and Khaite, all of which heavily featured it in their spring/summer 2025 collections.\", 'score': 0.8387567429063361, 'raw_content': 'These Are the 7 Most Important 2025 Fashion Trends | Who What Wear\\n Who What Wear\\nUS Edition\\n\\n\\nUS\\n\\nAustralia\\n\\nUK\\nshop with isa\\nSubscribe\\n×\\nSearch\\nshop with isa\\n\\n\\nTrends Trends\\n\\n\\nsub-nav-trends [ ]  sub-nav-trends\\n        *   View all Trends\\n        *   Spring\\n        *   Summer\\n        *   Fall\\n        *   Winter\\n        *   Runway\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOutfits Outfits\\n\\n\\nsub-nav-outfits [ ]  sub-nav-outfits\\n        *   View all Outfits\\n        *   Airport Style\\n        *   Office\\n        *   Street Style\\n        *   Vacation\\n        *   Party\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShopping Shopping\\n\\n\\nsub-nav-shopping-guides [ ]  sub-nav-shopping-guides\\n        *   View all Shopping\\n        *   Denim\\n        *   Dresses\\n        *   Handbags\\n        *   Shoes\\n        *   Luxury\\n        *   Basics\\n        *   Jewelry\\n        *   Under $100\\n        *   Swim\\n        *   Lingerie\\n        *   Promo Codes\\n        *   Livestream Shopping\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeauty Beauty\\n\\n\\nsub-nav-beauty [ ]  sub-nav-beauty\\n        *   View all Beauty\\n        *   Hair\\n        *   Skin\\n        *   Makeup\\n        *   Nails\\n        *   Fragrance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLiving Living\\n\\n\\nsub-nav-living [ ]  sub-nav-living\\n        *   View all Living\\n        *   Travel\\n        *   Home\\n        *   Wedding\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPodcast Podcast\\n\\n\\n\\nsub-nav-podcast [ ]  sub-nav-podcast\\n        *   View all Podcast\\n        *   Who What Wear Podcast\\n        *   Second Life\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNEWSLETTER\\n\\n\\n\\nNo offers found\\n\\nHome\\nFashion\\nTrends\\n\\nSupported\\nThe Forecast: This Is What 2025 Fashion Will Look Like\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNEWSLETTER\\n\\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.\\n\\n(Image credit: @stephaniebroek; @hannamw; Launchmetrics Spotlight; Backgrid; Courtesy of The New Arrivals: Ilkyaz Ozel; Gilbert Carrasquillo/GC Images/Getty Images)\\nBy Eliza Huber\\npublished 17 December 2024\\nin Features\\nExactly 377 days ago, I wrote the 2024 version of this exact story and started by discussing the ever-changing fashion environment throughout the year prior. Back then, I was excited about the possibilities surrounding some of the industry\\'s more recent creative-director hires—including designers Matthieu Blazy at Bottega Veneta (Blazy started in 2020) and Louise Trotter at Carven. (Trotter started in 2023.) Changes were happening at major houses, new legacies were being built, and excitement was in the air. Little did I know then that 2024 would bring about even more variation. Just last week, Trotter announced her departure from Carven, followed by Blazy at Bottega Veneta. The Italian leather goods brand then named Trotter as Blazy\\'s successor. A few hours later, Chanel answered every fashion person\\'s most burning question: Who will take over from Virginie Viard? The answer was Blazy. That\\'s only two of the industry\\'s many swapped seats this year.\\nSuffice it to say, 2025 is on track to blow 2024\\'s chaotic and unpredictable energy out of the water, but that doesn\\'t mean we must go into the year completely blind. After studying the spring/summer 2025 runway collections and end-of-year culture shifts, I feel confident about my predictions about what\\'s to come in the next 365 days or so. Below, read up on 2025 fashion before the year even begins, from 180-degree aesthetic changes to fresh color trends.\\n\\n(Image credit: TheStewartofNY/GC Images/Getty Images; @hoskelsa; Launchmetrics Spotlight; @fannyekstrand; MEGA/GC Images/Getty Images)\\nThough this trend has been slowly creeping up for a few seasons now, Saint Laurent\\'s S/S 25 collection really put it on the map. We\\'re calling it a few different things, including soft power and power play, but generally speaking, it\\'s fashion\\'s move toward a softer version of workwear that isn\\'t as sharp and tailored as it\\'s been in the past. Suits are slightly more relaxed and oversize and styled personally with cuff bracelets, oversize sunglasses, and interesting outerwear. The trend extended to Bottega Veneta, Stella McCartney, and Christopher Esber. In a press release following Louis Vuitton\\'s show during Paris Fashion Week, the house\\'s creative director Nicolas Ghesquière called soft power the ultimate oxymoron given that softness and power are often seen as opposites. However, where they meet is really where successful women reside. They\\'re multifaceted beings who are able to balance the two contrasting concepts naturally.\\nGoing into 2025, expect this new corporate aesthetic to hit the streets more and more. We\\'ve already seen Saint Laurent\\'s versions on Hailey Bieber and Rosé, but there will, no doubt, be unique takes hitting our social media feeds everywhere very soon. To help you out, here\\'s a tutorial on how to tie a tie. You\\'ll need it.\\n\\nZARA\\nStriped Silk-Viscose Tie\\n$46\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nZARA\\n100% Wool Jacket\\n$139\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nMiu Miu\\nRegard Sunglasses\\n$505\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\n(Image credit: John Nacion/Getty Images; Taylor Hill/WireImage; Gilbert Carrasquillo/GC Images/Getty Images; Courtesy of Prada; Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic/Getty Images; Gilbert Carrasquillo/GC Images/Getty Images; Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images)\\nI recently attended the Shark Beauty Women\\'s Champions Classic, a two-game NCAA basketball event at Barclays Center, and the turnout for the second game of the night between the University of Connecticut (UConn) Huskies and the University of Louisville Cardinals was unlike anything I\\'ve ever seen. The place was packed, especially with women and girls, many of whom wore one specific T-shirt (unless they were wearing merch for UConn star player and Nike athlete Paige Bueckers) by the brand Togethxr. The tee is simple with four words printed on the front in all caps: Everyone watches women\\'s sports.\\nThat T-shirt says it all. According to a report published this month by Morning Consult, an American intelligence company, the WNBA was 2024\\'s fastest-growing brand among all U.S. adults. It was the first time since the company was founded in 2014 that a sports league ranked first on this list. According to StubHub, ticket sales were up nearly 10 times in 2024 compared to 2023 before the season even began. \"This year\\'s NCAA Women\\'s Final Four and the WNBA Finals were the best-selling in StubHub history,\" the company published in a recent report. But it\\'s not just women\\'s basketball that\\'s on an upward trajectory.\\nFollowing the Paris Olympics, which saw 28 out of 32 sports be fully gender equal, female medalists like Suni Lee, Tara Davis-Woodhall, and Ilona Maher were ubiquitous, particularly at fashion events. At the tail end of 2024, female athletes were spotted front row at New York Fashion Week; on the red carpet at the CFDA Awards, GQ Men of the Year event, and Victoria\\'s Secret Fashion Show; and courtside at sporting events decked out in stylish designer garb. Clearly, fashion has noticed the impact women are having on sports and those who view them, and brands, from Prada to Tory Burch, are getting involved in the action.\\n\\ntogethxr\\nWomen\\'s Sports Tee\\n$45\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nadidas x Wales Bonner\\nSamba Croco Sneakers\\n$250\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nPrada\\nLeather Bomber Jacket\\n$8800\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\n(Image credit: @sofiagrainge; @fannyekstrand; Launchmetrics Spotlight; Courtesy of The New Arrivals: Ilkyaz Ozel; @elizagracehuber; @annabelrosendahl)\\nRemember when quiet luxury swept the fashion world and had everyone parting ways with anything in their wardrobe resembling bright colors and vibrant patterns? Same. Well, if you were one of the smart few who put those items in storage instead of sending them away to be donated or sold, give yourself a pat on the back. Come 2025, those are the exact pieces you\\'ll want to grab.\\nOn the spring/summer 2025 runways, a far louder and more extravagant aesthetic made the rounds, appearing most prominently at Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen, Dolce & Gabbana, and Schiaparelli. Chanel\\'s recent Pre-Fall 25 collection took a similar approach, showcasing metallic gold from head to toe, feathers, supple satin, and lots of jewelry. All in all, the runways proved that excess, glamour, and opulence will reign in the year ahead. According to the Instagram account @databutmakeitfashion, Google Search data agrees, showing that the popularity of quiet luxury fashion steadily decreased by 25% in November 2024. Ready your animal prints and lobe-drooping earrings—it\\'s time for your outfits to scream wealth, not whisper it.\\n\\nBy Malene Birger\\nRowani Jacket\\n$3300\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nschiaparelli\\nMouth and Eye Earrings\\n$1939\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nTory Burch\\nWool Skirt\\n$998$699\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\n(Image credit: @hannamw; Rosdiana Ciaravolo/Getty Images; Christian Vierig/Getty Images; Backgrid; Robert Okine/Getty Images for Lionsgate; Launchmetrics Spotlight; @himichelleli)\\nAnother change I\\'m expecting to see in 2025 following the decline in popularity of quiet luxury is an uptick in weight put on personal style. This was very much apparent on the spring/summer 2025 runways, with Miuccia Prada (and Raf Simons) leading the way at Miu Miu and Prada. At the shows in Paris and Milan respectively, models walked in vastly different looks from the person prior, and no one aesthetic or trend stood out. \"Humanity can be defined by its unpredictability, a rejection of the derivative and expected,\" a press release for Prada\\'s show stated. \"A sequence of concurrent realities are here dedications to the individual, every look a unique reflection of their present.\"\\nThis shift away from uniformity wasn\\'t only seen on the runways. In terms of street style, fashion people who\\'ve become known for their unique tastes and abilities to put together ensembles that are identifiable and precisely their own are being spotlighted and rewarded more and more. Think Jenny Walton, Vogue senior fashion editor Naomi Elizée, Neiman Marcus\\'s fashion market and editorial director Chloe King, and stylist and editor Michelle Li. In other words, it\\'s worth it to do some self-exploration and figure out what you like to wear and what feels like you ahead of the New Year.\\n\\nmains de vapeur\\nCoeur Beanie\\n$395\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nMiu Miu\\nLeather Keychain Trick\\n$625\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nJW Anderson\\nHedgehog Clutch\\n$890\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\n(Image credit: @nlmarilyn; @rikkekrefting; @stephaniebroek; @elizagracehuber; Launchmetrics Spotlight; Claudio Lavenia/Getty Images)\\nIf I\\'ve learned anything from fashion this year, it\\'s the importance of investing in long-lasting, timeless pieces—a lesson I\\'m planning to put into effect throughout 2025. No more purchasing items on a whim. Everything I buy next year, or at least most things, need to fulfill my goal of building a collection of future heirlooms. I want things that I can pass down to loved ones that, no matter what, will never go out of style. When I look around the fashion world, it\\'s easy to see that others are shopping with a similar mindset. Luxury watches like Bulgari\\'s Serpenti and Cartier\\'s Baignoire are on the rise, both of which will likely go up in value over time and continue to be standout accessories for decades to come. Newer pieces like the not-yet-named Derby-like Hermès bag, Alaïa\\'s Le Teckel clutch, Chanel\\'s patent-leather moccasins, and Balenciaga\\'s Rodeo bag also come to mind when I think of this anti-trend shift. Sure, they\\'ll be everywhere in 2025, but when the year ends, you\\'ll still very much want and wear them, making them worth spending on.\\n\\nAlaïa\\nLe Teckel Clutch\\n$2350\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nBulgari\\nSerpenti Tubogas Watch\\n$12400\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nDior\\n30\\xa0Montaigne Bar Jacket\\n$5000\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\n(Image credit: Courtesy of Dries Van Noten; Victor Virgile/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images; Joe Maher/Getty Images; Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images; Estrop/Getty Images; Franco Origlia/Getty Images)\\nBlazy and Trotter were far from the only designers to say goodbye to their previous fashion roles and hello to new ones in the last year. In March, Dries Van Noten announced he would be stepping down from the helm of his namesake brand. His successor, Julian Klausner, was announced in early December. In July, less than a year after he took the job, Peter Hawkings exited his role as creative director at Tom Ford. Two months later, Haider Ackermann was appointed to the position. \"He is an incredible colorist, his tailoring is sharp, and above all, he is modern,\" said Ford of the appointment in a press release. On September 29, we saw Alessandro Michele present his first runway collection for Valentino. (The French house announced his hiring in March 2024.) Of course, we have the confirmed news of Blazy\\'s and Trotter\\'s new positions too, but that\\'s not all. There are also rumors swirling around fashion circles and the internet about Jonathan Anderson, Loewe\\'s creative director since 2013 and the founder of London brand JW Anderson. Will he leave Loewe? Is he headed to Dior? Unlike all of the other aforementioned shifts, this is one piece of information with zero confirmation. I guess we\\'ll have to wait until 2025 to see.\\n\\nBottega Veneta\\nAndiamo Clutch\\n$2950\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nCARVEN\\nScarf Voile Blouse\\n$1290\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nCHANEL\\nSlingbacks\\n$1225\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\n(Image credit: @jilla.tequila; Samir Hussein/WireImage/Getty Images; Launchmetrics Spotlight; Steve Granitz/FilmMagic/Getty Images; @hoskelsa; @elizagracehuber)\\nIf 2024 was all about red, from traditional to burgundy, 2025 will be centered on pale pink, and it\\'s not just because it\\'s Glinda Upland\\'s favorite color.

Businesses will have to deal with the aftereffects of the global pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, economic challenges, as well as an ever-faster development of technologies.\\nHere are the trends I believe will have the greatest day-to-day impact on the way we work and do business in 2023.\\nThe 5 Biggest Business Trends For 2023\\nAdobe Stock\\n1. Accelerated digital transformation\\nIn 2023, we see the continuation of innovations and developments in transformative technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), cloud computing, blockchain, and super-fast network protocols like 5G. What’s more, these transformational digital technologies do not exist in isolation from each other, and we will see the boundaries between them blurring. New solutions for augmented working, hybrid and remote working, business decision-making, and automation of manual, routine, and creative workloads combine these technologies in ways that enable them to enhance each other. This brings us closer than ever to the point where we are able to create “intelligent enterprises” where systems and processes support each other to complete menial and mundane tasks in the most efficient way possible.\\nTo prepare for this, businesses must ensure they embed the right technology throughout their processes and in every area of operations. At this point, there is really very little excuse for being in business and not having an understanding of how AI and the other technologies mentioned above will impact your business and industry. More effective sales and marketing, better customer service, more efficient supply chains, products and services that are more aligned with customer needs, and streamlined manufacturing processes are all on the table, and in 2023, the barriers to accessing them will be lower than ever. Many of these technologies, such as AI and blockchain, are now available in \\'as-a-service\\' models via the cloud, and new interfaces and apps give businesses access to them via no-code environments.\\n2. Inflation and supply chain security\\nThe economic outlook for most of the world doesn’t look great in 2023. We are told by experts to expect ongoing inflation and subdued economic growth. Many industries are still plagued by supply chain issues that emerged during the global shutdowns caused by Covid-19 and have only got worse due to the war in Ukraine. To combat this and stay afloat, companies need to improve their resilience in any way that they can. This means reducing exposure to volatile market pricing of commodities, as well as building protective measures into supply chains to deal with shortages and rising logistical costs.\\nIt is important that companies map out their entire supply chains and identify any exposure to supply and inflation risks. That way, they can explore ways to mitigate that risk, such as alternative suppliers and becoming more self-reliant. I have recently worked with a number of companies that decided to in-source parts of their manufacturing after they identified a risk of relying on Chinese manufacturing that is still plagued by a zero-Covid policy and subsequent shutdowns.\\nMORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR\\n### Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne Contributor\\n\\n### Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton Contributor\\n\\n3. Sustainability\\nThe world is increasingly waking up to the fact that the climate disaster will pose a much bigger challenge than anything we have experienced in recent decades and will dwarf the challenges faced by the Covid pandemic. That means investors and consumers prefer businesses with the right environmental and social credentials, and buying trends are increasingly being driven by conscious consumers – those among us who prioritize factors such as ecological impact and sustainability when choosing who to buy from or do business with.\\nIn 2023, companies need to make sure that their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) processes are moved to the center of their strategy. This should start with measuring the impact any business is having on society and the environment and then move to increasing transparency, reporting, and accountability. Every business needs a plan with clear goals and timeframes of how to reduce any negative impacts, and then the plan needs to be underpinned by solid action plans. The assessment and plans should also go beyond the company walls and cover the entire supply chain and the ESG credentials of suppliers. For example, it is easy to forget the environmental impact of cloud service providers and the impact of data centers on the environment.\\n4. Immersive customer experience\\nIn 2023, customers crave experience above all else. That doesn\\'t necessarily mean that price point and quality take a back seat, though. Both play a part, to some extent, in the way we experience the process of choosing, purchasing, and enjoying the goods and services we spend our money on.\\nThe role that technology plays here, traditionally, has been to streamline processes and remove hassle from the life of the consumer. Think recommendation engines that help us choose what to buy or online customer service portals that deal with problems and after-sales support. These will still play a key role in 2023, but the game has evolved, with this year’s keywords being immersion and interactivity.\\nThe metaverse – something of a catch-all term used by futurists to describe the “next level” of the internet, where we interact with brands and fellow consumers through immersive technology, including 3D environments and VR – is the stage where this will play out. Think of online shops where we can browse and \"try on\" virtual representations of clothes, jewelry, and accessories. We might use virtual dressing rooms to dress up avatars of ourselves – as pioneered already by the likes of Hugo Boss – or it could involve AR, as used by Walmart, to see how clothes will fit on our actual bodies. These trends will impact both online and offline retail.\\nThe trend towards experience is so strong that brands like Adobe and Adweek are appointing chief experience officers (CXO) to ensure that it is made a foundational element of business strategy. As well as customer experience, businesses increasingly need to think about employee experience as competition for the most talented and skilled workers grows more intense.\\n5. The talent challenge\\nOver the past year, we have seen huge movements of talented people, referred to as the great resignation and quiet quitting, as workers reassessed the impact of work and what they want to get out of their lives. This has put pressure on employers to ensure they are providing attractive careers, the flexibility of hybrid work, and an enticing work environment and company culture. Offering people fulfilling work, ongoing opportunities to grow and learn, flexibility and diverse, value-oriented workplaces will all be essential in 2023.\\nOn top of that, the accelerated digital transformation (trend one above) leads to more workplace automation that will augment pretty much every single job in the world. Humans will increasingly share their work with intelligent machines and smart robots, and that has huge implications for the skills and talent companies require in the future. This will mean reskilling and up-skilling huge sways of people in our businesses as well as recruiting new people that have the skills needed for the future.\\nOn the one hand side, businesses must deal with the vast skills gap that exists in areas such as data science, AI, and other technology areas, ensuring they are creating the data and tech-savvy workforce needed to succeed in the future. And on the other side, as human jobs get augmented by technology, businesses must re-train staff with skills needed to work alongside smart machines and to grow their uniquely human skills that currently can’t be automated. In 2023, it will include skills such as creativity, critical thinking, interpersonal communication, leadership, and applying “humane” qualities like caring and compassion.\\nTo stay on top of the latest on the latest business and tech trends, make sure to subscribe to my newsletter, follow me on Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube, and check out my books ‘Business Trends in Practice’ and ‘Future Skills’.\\nFollow me on\\xa0Twitter\\xa0or\\xa0LinkedIn.\\xa0Check out\\xa0my\\xa0website\\xa0or\\xa0some of my other work\\xa0here.\\xa0\\n\\nBernard Marr\\nFollowing\\n\\nEditorial Standards\\nForbes Accolades\\n\\nJoin The Conversation\\nComments\\xa0\\nOne Community.

What are the most important trends that business leaders should be prepared for?\\nThe Top 10 Tech Trends In 2023 Everyone Must Be Ready For\\nAdobe Stock\\nRead on for the ten essential tech trends you should be following in 2023.\\n1. AI Everywhere\\nIn 2023, artificial intelligence will become real in organizations. No-code AI, with its easy drag-and-drop interfaces, will enable any business to leverage its power to create more intelligent products and services.\\nWe’re already seeing this trend in the retail market. Stitch Fix uses AI-enabled algorithms to recommend clothes to its customers that match their sizes and tastes.\\nContactless, autonomous shopping and delivery will also be a huge trend for 2023. AI will make it easier for consumers to pay for and receive goods and services.\\nAI will also augment nearly every job in every business process across industries. More retailers will use AI to manage and automate the complex inventory management processes that happen behind the scenes, so convenience trends like buy-online-pickup-at-curbside (BOPAC), buy-online-pickup-in-store (BOPIS), and buy-online-return-in-store (BORIS), will become standard.\\nMORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR\\n### Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne Contributor\\n\\n### Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton Contributor\\n\\nAI will also be the engine behind the newest autonomous delivery initiatives that retailers are piloting and rolling out, and more and more retail workers will need to get used to working alongside machines to do their jobs.\\n2. Parts of the Metaverse Will Become Real\\nI don’t particularly care for the term “metaverse,” but it’s become shorthand for a more immersive internet where we’ll be able to work, play, and socialize on a persistent platform.\\nExperts predict that the metaverse will add $5 trillion to the global economy by 2030, and 2023 will be the year that defines the direction of the metaverse for the next decade.\\nAugmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technology will continue to advance. One area to watch is the work environment in the metaverse — in 2023, I predict that we’ll have more immersive meeting environments where we can talk, brainstorm, and co-create together.\\nIn fact, Microsoft and Nvidia are already developing metaverse platforms for collaborating on digital projects.\\nWe’ll also see more advanced avatar technology in the new year. An avatar — the presence we project as we engage with other users in the metaverse — could look exactly like we do in the real world, and motion capture will even enable our avatars to adopt our unique body language and gestures.\\nWe also might see further development in AI-enabled autonomous avatars that can act as our representatives in the metaverse, even if we’re not logged into the digital world.\\nCompanies are already using metaverse technology like AR and VR to conduct training and onboarding, and this trend will accelerate in 2023. Consulting giant Accenture has already created a metaverse environment called the Nth Floor. This virtual world features replicas of real-world Accenture offices, so new hires and current employees can carry out HR-related tasks without needing to be present in a physical office.\\n3. Progress in Web3\\nBlockchain technology will also advance significantly in 2023 as companies create more decentralized products and services.\\nFor example, at the moment, we’re storing everything in the cloud — but if we decentralize data storage and encrypt that data using blockchain, our information will not only be safer, but we’ll have innovative ways to access and analyze it.\\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) will become more usable and practical in the new year. For example, NFT tickets to concerts will potentially give you access to backstage experiences and memorabilia. NFTs might be the keys we use to interact with many of the digital products and services we buy, or they could represent contracts we enter into with other parties.\\n4. Bridging the Digital and Physical World\\nWe’re already seeing an emerging bridge between the digital and physical worlds, and this trend will continue in 2023. There are two components of this merger: digital twin technology and 3D printing.\\nDigital twins are virtual simulations of real-world processes, operations, or products that can be used to test new ideas in a safe digital environment. Designers and engineers are using digital twins to recreate physical objects inside virtual worlds, so they can test under every conceivable condition without the high costs of real-life experiments. In 2023, we’ll see even more digital twins, from factories to machinery to cars to precision healthcare.\\nAfter testing in the virtual world, engineers can tweak and edit components, then create them in the real world using 3D printing technology.\\nFor example, Formula 1 teams currently collect data transmitted from sensors during races, as well as race track temperatures and weather conditions, to see how cars change during races. Then they stream the data from the sensors to digital twins of the engines and car components and run scenarios to make design changes on the fly. The teams then 3D print car parts based on the results of their testing.\\n5. Increasingly Editable Nature\\nWe will live in a world where we can make changes to material, plants, and even humans by editing them. Nanotechnology will enable us to create materials with completely new features, such as water resistance and self-healing capabilities.\\nCRISPR-Cas9 has been around for a few years, but in 2023 we’ll see gene editing technology accelerate to give us the increasing capability to “edit nature” by altering DNA.\\nGene editing works a bit like word processing, where you can take some words out and add others in — but you can do it with genes. Gene editing can be used to correct DNA mutations, solve the problem of food allergies, increase the health of crops, or even edit human characteristics like eye and hair color.\\n6. Quantum Progress\\nRight now, there is a worldwide race to develop quantum computing at scale.\\nQuantum computing, which uses subatomic particles to create new ways of processing and storing information, is a technological leap that’s expected to bring us computers capable of operating a trillion times more quickly than the fastest traditional processors available today.\\nThe potential danger of quantum computing is that it could render our current encryption practices useless — so any nation that develops quantum computing at scale could break the encryption of other nations, businesses, security systems, and more. This is a trend to watch carefully in 2023 as countries like the US, UK, China, and Russia pour money into developing quantum computing technology.\\n7. Progress in Green Technology\\nOne of the biggest challenges the world is facing right now is putting the brakes on our carbon emissions so we can tackle the climate crisis.\\nIn 2023, look for continued progress around green hydrogen, a new clean-burning source of energy that produces close to zero greenhouse gas emissions. Shell and RWE, two major European energy companies, are creating the first major green pipeline from wind plants in the North Sea.\\nWe’ll also see progress in the development of decentralized power grids. Distributed energy generation using this model provides a system of small power generators and storage that are located in communities or individual houses — so they can provide power even if the main grid is not available. Right now, our energy system is primarily dominated by huge gas and energy companies, but decentralized energy initiatives have the potential to democratize power worldwide while decreasing carbon emissions.\\n8. Robots Will Become More Human\\nIn 2023, robots will become even more like humans — in appearance and capability. These types of robots will be used in the real world as event greeters, bartenders, concierges, and companions for older adults. They’ll also perform complex tasks in warehouses and factories as they work alongside humans in manufacturing and logistics.\\nOne company is working hard to create a human-like robot that will work in our homes. At Tesla AI Day in September 2022, Elon Musk revealed two Optimus humanoid robot prototypes, and said the company would be ready to take orders within the next 3 to 5 years. The robot can perform simple tasks like lifting items and watering plants — so perhaps soon we\\'ll be able to have \"robot butlers\" that help around in the house.\\n9. Progress in Autonomous System\\nBusiness leaders will continue making progress in creating autonomous systems, particularly around delivery and logistics. Many factories and warehouses have already become partially or fully autonomous.\\nIn 2023, we’ll see even more self-driving trucks and ships, as well as delivery robots — and even more warehouses and factories will implement autonomous technology.\\nOcado, a British online supermarket that describes itself as “the world’s largest dedicated online grocery retailer,” uses thousands of autonomous robots in its highly automated warehouses to sort, lift, and move groceries. The warehouse also uses AI to place the most popular items within easy reach of the robots. The Ocado company is now rolling out the autonomous technology behind their successful warehouses to other grocery retailers.\\n10. More Sustainable Technology\\nFinally, we\\'ll see a push toward more sustainable technology in 2023. Many (if not most) of us are addicted to technology like our smartphones, tablets, and computers — but where are the components coming from to manufacture our favorite gadgets? People will be thinking more about where rare earth components for things like computer chips originate and how we\\'re consuming them.\\nWe’re also using cloud services like Netflix and Spotify, which still run in huge data centers that consume vast amounts of energy.\\nIn 2023, we’ll see a continued push toward making supply chains more transparent, as consumers demand that the products and services they invest in are energy efficient and backed by more sustainable technology.\\nTo stay on top of the latest on new and emerging business and tech trends, make sure to subscribe to my newsletter, follow me on Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube, and check out my books ‘Tech Trends in Practice’ and ‘Business Trends in Practice, which just won the 2022 Business Book of the Year award.\\nFollow me on\\xa0Twitter\\xa0or\\xa0LinkedIn.\\xa0Check out\\xa0my\\xa0website\\xa0or\\xa0some of my other work\\xa0here.\\xa0\\n\\nBernard Marr\\nFollowing\\n\\nEditorial Standards\\nForbes Accolades\\n\\nJoin The Conversation\\nComments\\xa0\\nOne Community.

Generative AI (gen AI) has been a standout trend since 2022, with the extraordinary uptick in interest and investment in this technology unlocking innovative possibilities across interconnected trends such as robotics and immersive reality. While the macroeconomic environment with elevated interest rates has affected equity capital investment and hiring, underlying indicators—including optimism, innovation, and longer-term talent needs—reflect a positive long-term trajectory in the 15 technology trends we analyzed.\\nWhat’s new in this year’s analysis\\n\\nThis year, we reflected the shifts in the technology landscape with two changes on the list of trends: digital trust and cybersecurity (integrating what we had previously described as Web3 and trust architectures) and the future of robotics. Robotics technologies’ synergy with AI is paving the way for groundbreaking innovations and operational shifts across the economic and workforce landscapes. We also deployed a survey to measure adoption levels across trends.\\nThese are among the findings in the latest McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook, in which the McKinsey Technology Council\\xa0identified the most significant technology trends unfolding today. This research is intended to help executives plan ahead by developing an understanding of potential use cases, sources of value, adoption drivers, and the critical skills needed to bring these opportunities to fruition.\\nOur analysis examines quantitative measures of interest, innovation, investment, and talent to gauge the momentum of each trend. Recognizing the long-term nature and interdependence of these trends, we also delve into the underlying technologies, uncertainties, and questions surrounding each trend. (For more about new developments in our research, please see the sidebar “What’s new in this year’s analysis”; for more about the research itself, please see the sidebar “Research methodology.”)\\nNew and notable\\nThe two trends that stood out in 2023 were gen AI and electrification and renewables. Gen AI has seen a spike of almost 700 percent in Google searches from 2022 to 2023, along with a notable jump in job postings and investments. The pace of technology innovation has been remarkable. Over the course of 2023 and 2024, the size of the prompts that large language models (LLMs) can process, known as “context windows,” spiked from 100,000 to two million tokens. This is roughly the difference between adding one research paper to a model prompt and adding about 20 novels to it. And the modalities that gen AI can process have continued to increase, from text summarization and image generation to advanced capabilities in video, images, audio, and text. This has catalyzed a surge in investments and innovation aimed at advancing more powerful and efficient computing systems. The large foundation models that power generative AI, such as LLMs, are being integrated into various enterprise software tools and are also being employed for diverse purposes such as powering customer-facing chatbots, generating ad campaigns, accelerating drug discovery, and more. We expect this expansion to continue, pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities. Senior leaders’ awareness of gen AI innovation has increased interest, investment, and innovation in AI technologies, such as robotics, which is a new addition to our trends analysis this year. Advancements in AI are ushering in a new era of more capable robots, spurring greater innovation and a wider range of deployments.\\nResearch methodology\\n\\nTo assess the development of each technology trend, our team collected data on five tangible measures of activity: search engine queries, news publications, patents, research publications, and investment. For each measure, we used a defined set of data sources to find occurrences of keywords associated with each of the 15 trends, screened those occurrences for valid mentions of activity, and indexed the resulting numbers of mentions on a 0–1 scoring scale that is relative to the trends studied. The innovation score combines the patents and research scores; the interest score combines the news and search scores. (While we recognize that an interest score can be inflated by deliberate efforts to stimulate news and search activity, we believe that each score fairly reflects the extent of discussion and debate about a given trend.) Investment measures the flows of funding from the capital markets into companies linked with the trend.\\nData sources for the scores include the following:\\n\\nPatents. Data on patent filings are sourced from Google Patents, where the data highlight the number of granted patents.\\nResearch. Data on research publications are sourced from Lens.\\nNews. Data on news publications are sourced from Factiva.\\nSearches. Data on search engine queries are sourced from Google Trends.\\nInvestment. Data on private-market and public-market capital raises (venture capital and corporate and strategic M&A, including joint ventures), private equity (including buyouts and private investment in public equity), and public investments (including IPOs) are sourced from PitchBook.\\nTalent demand. Number of job postings is sourced from McKinsey’s proprietary Organizational Data Platform, which stores licensed, de-identified data on professional profiles and job postings. Data are drawn primarily from English-speaking countries.\\n\\nIn addition, we updated the selection and definition of trends from last year’s report to reflect the evolution of technology trends:\\n\\nThe future of robotics trend was added since last year’s publication.\\nData sources and keywords were updated. For data on the future of space technologies investments, we used research from McKinsey’s Aerospace & Defense Practice.\\n\\nFinally, we used survey data to calculate the enterprise-wide adoption scores for each trend:\\n\\nSurvey scope. The survey included approximately 1,000 respondents from 50 countries.\\nGeographical coverage. Survey representation was balanced across Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and North America.\\nCompany size. Size categories, based on annual revenue, included small companies ($10 million to $50 million), medium-size companies ($50 million to $1 billion), and large companies (greater than $1 billion).\\nRespondent profile. The survey was targeted to senior-level professionals knowledgeable in technology, who reported their perception of the extent to which their organizations were using the technologies.\\nSurvey method. The survey was conducted online to enhance reach and accessibility.\\nQuestion types. The survey employed multiple-choice and open-ended questions for comprehensive insights.\\nDefinition of enterprise-wide adoption scores:\\n1: Frontier innovation. This technology is still nascent, with few organizations investing in or applying it. It is largely untested and unproven in a business context.\\n2: Experimentation. Organizations are testing the functionality and viability of the technology with a small-scale prototype, typically done without a strong focus on a near-term ROI. Few companies are scaling or have fully scaled the technology.\\n3: Piloting. Organizations are implementing the technology for the first few business use cases. It may be used in pilot projects or limited deployments to test its feasibility and effectiveness.\\n4: Scaling. Organizations are in the process of scaling the deployment and adoption of the technology across the enterprise. The technology is being scaled by a significant number of companies.\\n5: Fully scaled. Organizations have fully deployed and integrated the technology across the enterprise. It has become the standard and is being used at a large scale as companies have recognized the value and benefits of the technology.\\n\\n\\n\\nElectrification and renewables was the other trend that bucked the economic headwinds, posting the highest investment and interest scores among all the trends we evaluated. Job postings for this sector also showed a modest increase.\\nAlthough many trends faced declines in investment and hiring in 2023, the long-term outlook remains positive. This optimism is supported by the continued longer-term growth in job postings for the analyzed trends (up 8 percent from 2021 to 2023) and enterprises’ continued innovation and heightened interest in harnessing these technologies, particularly for future growth.\\nIn 2023, technology equity investments fell by 30 to 40 percent to approximately $570 billion due to rising financing costs and a cautious near-term growth outlook, prompting investors to favor technologies with strong revenue and margin potential. This approach aligns with the strategic perspective leading companies are adopting, in which they recognize that fully adopting and scaling cutting-edge technologies is a long-term endeavor. This recognition is evident when companies diversify their investments across a portfolio of several technologies, selectively intensifying their focus on areas most likely to push technological boundaries forward. While many technologies have maintained cautious investment profiles over the past year, gen AI saw a sevenfold increase in investments, driven by substantial advancements in text, image, and video generation.\\nDespite an overall downturn in private equity investment, the pace of innovation has not slowed. Innovation has accelerated in the three trends that are part of the “AI revolution” group: gen AI, applied AI, and industrializing machine learning. Gen AI creates new content from unstructured data (such as text and images), applied AI leverages machine learning models for analytical and predictive tasks, and industrializing machine learning accelerates and derisks the development of machine learning solutions. Applied AI and industrializing machine learning, boosted by the widening interest in gen AI, have seen the most significant uptick in innovation, reflected in the surge in publications and patents from 2022 to 2023. Meanwhile, electrification and renewable-energy technologies continue to capture high interest, reflected in news mentions and web searches. Their popularity is fueled by a surge in global renewable capacity, their crucial roles in global decarbonization efforts, and heightened energy security needs amid geopolitical tensions and energy crises.\\nThe talent environment largely echoed the investment picture in tech trends in 2023. The technology sector faced significant layoffs, particularly among large technology companies, with job postings related to the tech trends we studied declining by 26 percent—a steeper drop than the 17 percent decrease in global job postings overall. The greater decline in demand for tech-trends-related talent may have been fueled by technology companies’ cost reduction efforts amid decreasing revenue growth projections. Despite this reduction, the trends with robust investment and innovation, such as gen AI, not only maintained but also increased their job postings, reflecting a strong demand for new and advanced skills. Electrification and renewables was the other trend that saw positive job growth, partially due to public sector support for infrastructure spending.\\nEven with the short-term vicissitudes in talent demand, our analysis of 4.3 million job postings across our 15 tech trends underscored a wide skills gap. Compared with the global average, fewer than half the number of potential candidates have the high-demand tech skills specified in job postings. Despite the year-on-year decreases for job postings in many trends from 2022 to 2023, the number of tech-related job postings in 2023 still represented an 8 percent increase from 2021, suggesting the potential for longer-term growth (Exhibit 1).\\nEnterprise technology adoption momentum\\nThe trajectory of enterprise technology adoption is often described as an S-curve that traces the following pattern: technical innovation and exploration, experimenting with the technology, initial pilots in the business, scaling the impact throughout the business, and eventual fully scaled adoption (Exhibit 2). This pattern is evident in this year’s survey analysis of enterprise adoption conducted across our 15 technologies. Adoption levels vary across different industries and company sizes, as does the perceived progress toward adoption.\\n\\nImage description:\\nA graph depicts the adoption curve of technology trends, scored from 1 to 5, where 1 represents frontier innovation, located at the bottom left corner of the curve; 2 is experimenting, located slightly above frontier innovation; 3 is piloting, which follows the upward trajectory of the curve; 4 is scaling, marked by a vertical ascent as adoption increases; and 5 is fully scaled, positioned at the top of the curve, indicating near-complete adoption.\\nIn 2023, the trends are positioned along the adoption curve as follows: future of space technologies and quantum technologies are at the frontier innovation stage; climate technologies beyond electrification and renewables, future of bioengineering, future of mobility, future of robotics, and immersive-reality technologies are at the experimenting stage; digital trust and cybersecurity, electrification and renewables, industrializing machine learning, and next-gen software development are at the piloting stage; and advanced connectivity, applied AI, cloud and edge computing, and generative AI are at the scaling stage.\\nFootnote: Trend is more relevant to certain industries, resulting in lower overall adoption across industries compared with adoption within relevant industries.\\nSource: McKinsey technology adoption survey data\\nEnd of image description.\\nWe see that the technologies in the S-curve’s early stages of innovation and experimenting are either on the leading edge of progress, such as quantum technologies and robotics, or are more relevant to a specific set of industries, such as bioengineering and space. Factors that could affect the adoption of these technologies include high costs, specialized applications, and balancing the breadth of technology investments against focusing on a select few that may offer substantial first-mover advantages.\\nAs technologies gain traction and move beyond experimenting, adoption rates start accelerating, and companies invest more in piloting and scaling. We see this shift in a number of trends, such as next-generation software development and electrification. Gen AI’s rapid advancement leads among trends analyzed, about a quarter of respondents self-reporting that they are scaling its use. More mature technologies, like cloud and edge computing and advanced connectivity, continued their rapid pace of adoption, serving as enablers for the adoption of other emerging technologies as well (Exhibit 3).\\n\\nImage description:\\nA segmented bar graph shows the adoption levels of tech trends in 2023 as a percentage of respondents. The trends are divided into 5 segments, comprising 100%: fully scaled, scaling, piloting, experimenting, and not investing. The trends are arranged based on the combined percentage sum of fully scaled and scaling shares. Listed from highest to lowest, these combined percentages are as follows:\\n\\ncloud and edge computing at 48%\\nadvanced connectivity at 37%\\ngenerative AI at 36%\\napplied AI at 35%\\nnext-generation software development at 31%\\ndigital trust and cybersecurity at 30%\\nelectrification and renewables at 28%\\nindustrializing machine learning at 27%\\nfuture of mobility at 21%\\nclimate technologies beyond electrification and renewables at 20%\\nimmersive-reality technologies at 19%\\nfuture of bioengineering at 18%\\nfuture of robotics at 18%\\nquantum technologies at 15%\\nfuture of space technologies at 15%\\n\\nSource: McKinsey technology adoption survey data\\nEnd of image description.\\nThe process of scaling technology adoption also requires a conducive external ecosystem where user trust and readiness, business model economics, regulatory environments, and talent availability play crucial roles. Since these ecosystem factors vary by geography and industry, we see different adoption scenarios playing out. For instance, while the leading banks in Latin America are on par with their North American counterparts in deploying gen AI use cases, the adoption of robotics in manufacturing sectors varies significantly due to differing labor costs affecting the business case for automation.\\nAs executives navigate these complexities, they should align their long-term technology adoption strategies with both their internal capacities and the external ecosystem conditions to ensure the successful integration of new technologies into their business models. Executives should monitor ecosystem conditions that can affect their prioritized use cases to make decisions about the appropriate investment levels while navigating uncertainties and budgetary constraints on the way to full adoption (see the “Adoption developments across the globe” sections within each trend or particular use cases therein that executives should monitor). Across the board, leaders who take a long-term view—building up their talent, testing and learning where impact can be found, and reimagining the businesses for the future—can potentially break out ahead of the pack.\\nLareina Yee is a senior partner in McKinsey’s Bay Area office, where Michael Chui\\xa0is a McKinsey Global Institute partner, Roger Roberts\\xa0is a partner, and Mena Issler is an associate partner.\\nThe authors wish to thank the following McKinsey colleagues for their contributions to this research: Aakanksha Srinivasan, Ahsan Saeed, Alex Arutyunyants, Alex Singla, Alex Zhang, Alizee Acket-Goemaere, An Yan, Anass Bensrhir, Andrea Del Miglio, Andreas Breiter, Ani Kelkar, Anna Massey, Anna Orthofer, Arjit Mehta, Arjita Bhan, Asaf Somekh, Begum Ortaoglu, Benjamin Braverman, Bharat Bahl, Bharath Aiyer, Bhargs Srivathsan, Brian Constantine, Brooke Stokes, Bryan Richardson, Carlo Giovine, Celine Crenshaw, Daniel Herde, Daniel Wallance, David Harvey, Delphine Zurkiya, Diego Hernandez Diaz, Douglas Merrill, Elisa Becker-Foss, Emma Parry, Eric Hazan, Erika Stanzl, Everett Santana, Giacomo Gatto, Grace W Chen, Hamza Khan, Harshit Jain, Helen Wu, Henning Soller, Ian de Bode, Jackson Pentz, Jeffrey Caso, Jesse Klempner, Jim Boehm, Joshua Katz, Julia Perry, Julian Sevillano, Justin Greis, Kersten Heineke, Kitti Lakner, Kristen Jennings, Liz Grennan, Luke Thomas, Maria Pogosyan, Mark Patel, Martin Harrysson, Martin Wrulich, Martina Gschwendtner, Massimo Mazza, Matej Macak, Matt Higginson, Matt Linderman, Matteo Cutrera, Mellen Masea, Michiel Nivard, Mike Westover, Musa Bilal, Nicolas Bellemans, Noah Furlonge-Walker, Obi Ezekoye, Paolo Spranzi, Pepe Cafferata, Robin Riedel, Ryan Brukardt, Samuel Musmanno, Santiago Comella-Dorda, Sebastian Mayer, Shakeel Kalidas, Sharmila Bhide, Stephen Xu, Tanmay Bhatnagar, Thomas Hundertmark, Tinan Goli, Tom Brennan, Tom Levin-Reid, Tony Hansen, Vinayak HV, Yaron Haviv, Yvonne Ferrier, and Zina Cole.\\nThey also wish to thank the external members of the McKinsey Technology Council for their insights and perspectives, including Ajay Agrawal, Azeem Azhar, Ben Lorica, Benedict Evans, John Martinis, and Jordan Jacobs.\\n\\nSpecial thanks to McKinsey Global Publishing colleagues Barr Seitz, Diane Rice, Kanika Punwani, Katie Shearer, LaShon Malone, Mary Gayen, Nayomi Chibana, Richard Johnson, Stephen Landau, and Victor Cuevas for making this interactive come alive.\\nExplore a career with us\\nSearch Openings\\nRelated Articles\\n\\nArticle\\nRewired and running ahead: Digital and AI leaders are leaving the rest behind\\n\\nArticle\\nFalse friends or good ends?

Ayesha Khanna, co-founder and CEO of Addo, an AI and data solutions firm, predicts an explosion of AI-generated images and music in 2023. She adds that while it will not replace humans, “AI will become the new team member for humans in many jobs, contributing ideas and drafts.”\\n Hanson Robotics Why three robot sisters could be the friendly face of AI\\nBernard Marr, a futurist and author of books including “Future Skills” and “Business Trends in Practice,” also anticipates that this year, “a focus of AI will be the augmentation of workers, as new tools become available to enable workforces to fully leverage AI.”\\nBut Khanna warns that more work will be needed to ensure that generative AI co-pilots – such as GitHub’s Copilot, a tool designed to help developers code – are accurate and unbiased, especially in industries like healthcare, where there could be serious consequences to an AI assistant recommending the wrong treatment to a doctor.\\n\\nVideo Ad Feedback\\nThe brush strokes of AI art\\n02:15 - Source: CNN\\nThe brush strokes of AI art\\n02:15\\nThe metaverse\\nDespite Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, losing billions of dollars on its metaverse efforts, the idea of spending time in virtual online worlds is increasingly becoming part of the public consciousness, and the buzz is set to grow in 2023, according to Khanna.\\n“Retail and entertainment companies will launch increasing pilots on how to build customer engagement and loyalty in the various metaverses, especially game platforms like Roblox,” she says.\\n“Metaverse natives who have grown up gaming and socializing in alternate digital realities will drive companies to host concerts, fashion weeks, customer journeys and edutainment activities in 2023.”\\n American artist Daniel Arsham\\'s design for The Row included an interpretation on classical sculpture. courtesy Daniel Arsham/Everyrealm Pixel pushers: How the metaverse became real estate\\'s new frontier\\nMarr adds that more small companies will join the bigger organizations that have already established “outposts” on metaverse platforms.\\n“The metaverse will also become more mobile and accessible through devices such as headsets and smart glasses, and businesses will need to consider how they can leverage these opportunities to create immersive and efficient experiences,” he says.\\n\\nVideo Ad Feedback\\nWhat is the metaverse?\\n03:16 - Source: CNN\\nWhat is the metaverse?\\n03:16\\nSustainability tech\\n“The entire field of sustainability, underpinned by technologies, will play a monumental role in 2023,” says Abishur Prakash, co-founder and geopolitical futurist at the Center for Innovating the Future (CIF), in Toronto, and author of “The World is Vertical: How Technology is Remaking Globalization.”\\n“Clean energy projects, like those taking electricity generated by solar power from Africa to Europe, will advance in 2023, adding a new dimension to the global energy war.”\\nCynthia Selin, an associate professor at the School for the Future of Innovation in Society and the School of Sustainability at Arizona State University, believes that in 2023, as we continue to build more capacity for renewables, short-term and long-term energy storage such as batteries and hydrogen will be key.\\n“Continued investment and favorable policy conditions … mean that clean hydrogen (including hydrogen made using renewable energy) could see sustained growth, the development of necessary infrastructure, and better cost competitiveness,” she says. “In terms of consumer-facing developments in relation to hydrogen, in ’23 the most likely area of attention will be in long-haul trucking.”\\n\\nHyundai\\'s \"XCIENT Fuel Cell\" hydrogen-powered truck.\\nJulian Rettig/picture-alliance/dpa/AP\\nSelin believes carbon capture and storage – removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it – will grow in importance.\\n“Direct air capture may continue to gain attention alongside natural removal mechanisms like reforestation,” she says. “New demonstration projects are sprouting up worldwide in tandem with supportive policies, building our capacity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”\\nSemiconductors and self-reliance\\nPrakash predicts the war in Ukraine will usher in a new era of geopolitics and globalization.\\n“The pursuit of self-reliance, a catalyst of vertical globalization, will accelerate in 2023, affecting every aspect of technology,” he says. “Automakers in China are buying their own ships to export their cars to the world,” he adds, and points to Apple’s plans to move production outside China.\\nAnother trend to watch will be the fight over the semiconductors that power our smartphones, computers, automobiles and home appliances. Prakash says semiconductors are set to upend world affairs in 2023, and become an area of competition between the US and China.\\n\\nAdobe Stock\\nThe Internet of Things\\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of connected sensors and infrastructure that can collect data on everything from household heating to traffic jams on city streets.\\nSelin believes the IoT will continue to transform the energy sector in 2023. “Smart thermostats to track energy consumption and regulate temperatures help in reducing energy consumption and costs.

Generative AI deserves much of the credit for ushering in this revival, but it stands as just one of many advances on the horizon that could drive sustainable, inclusive growth and solve complex global challenges.\\nTo help executives track the latest developments, the McKinsey Technology Council\\xa0has once again identified and interpreted the most significant technology trends unfolding today. While many trends are in the early stages of adoption and scale, executives can use this research to plan ahead by developing an understanding of potential use cases and pinpointing the critical skills needed as they hire or upskill talent to bring these opportunities to fruition.\\nOur analysis examines quantitative measures of interest, innovation, and investment to gauge the momentum of each trend. Recognizing the long-term nature and interdependence of these trends, we also delve into underlying technologies, uncertainties, and questions surrounding each trend. This year, we added an important new dimension for analysis—talent. We provide data on talent supply-and-demand dynamics for the roles of most relevance to each trend. (For more, please see the sidebar, “Research methodology.”)\\nNew and notable\\nAll of last year’s 14 trends remain on our list, though some experienced accelerating momentum and investment, while others saw a downshift. One new trend, generative AI, made a loud entrance and has already shown potential for transformative business impact.\\nResearch methodology\\n\\nTo assess the development of each technology trend, our team collected data on five tangible measures of activity: search engine queries, news publications, patents, research publications, and investment. For each measure, we used a defined set of data sources to find occurrences of keywords associated with each of the 15 trends, screened those occurrences for valid mentions of activity, and indexed the resulting numbers of mentions on a 0–1 scoring scale that is relative to the trends studied. The innovation score combines the patents and research scores; the interest score combines the news and search scores. (While we recognize that an interest score can be inflated by deliberate efforts to stimulate news and search activity, we believe that each score fairly reflects the extent of discussion and debate about a given trend.) Investment measures the flows of funding from the capital markets into companies linked with the trend. Data sources for the scores include the following:\\n\\nPatents. Data on patent filings are sourced from Google Patents.\\nResearch. Data on research publications are sourced from the Lens (www.lens.org).\\nNews. Data on news publications are sourced from Factiva.\\nSearches. Data on search engine queries are sourced from Google Trends.\\nInvestment. Data on private-market and public-market capital raises are sourced from PitchBook.\\nTalent demand. Number of job postings is sourced from McKinsey’s proprietary Organizational Data Platform, which stores licensed, de-identified data on professional profiles and job postings. Data is drawn primarily from English-speaking countries.\\n\\nIn addition, we updated the selection and definition of trends from last year’s study to reflect the evolution of technology trends:\\n\\nThe generative-AI trend was added since last year’s study.\\nWe adjusted the definitions of electrification and renewables (previously called future of clean energy) and climate technologies beyond electrification and renewables (previously called future of sustainable consumption).\\nData sources were updated. This year, we included only closed deals in PitchBook data, which revised downward the investment numbers for 2018–22. For future of space technologies investments, we used research from McKinsey’s Aerospace & Defense Practice.\\n\\nThis new entrant represents the next frontier of AI. Building upon existing technologies such as applied AI and industrializing machine learning, generative AI has high potential and applicability across most industries. Interest in the topic (as gauged by news and internet searches) increased threefold from 2021 to 2022. As we recently wrote, generative AI and other foundational models\\xa0change the AI game by taking assistive technology to a new level, reducing application development time, and bringing powerful capabilities to nontechnical users. Generative AI is poised to add as much as $4.4 trillion in economic value from a combination of specific use cases and more diffuse uses—such as assisting with email drafts—that increase productivity. Still, while generative AI can unlock significant value, firms should not underestimate the economic significance and the growth potential that underlying AI technologies and industrializing machine learning can bring to various industries.\\nInvestment in most tech trends tightened year over year, but the potential for future growth remains high, as further indicated by the recent rebound in tech valuations. Indeed, absolute investments remained strong in 2022, at more than $1 trillion combined, indicating great faith in the value potential of these trends. Trust architectures and digital identity grew the most out of last year’s 14 trends, increasing by nearly 50 percent as security, privacy, and resilience become increasingly critical across industries. Investment in other trends—such as applied AI, advanced connectivity, and cloud and edge computing—declined, but that is likely due, at least in part, to their maturity. More mature technologies can be more sensitive to short-term budget dynamics than more nascent technologies with longer investment time horizons, such as climate and mobility technologies. Also, as some technologies become more profitable, they can often scale further with lower marginal investment. Given that these technologies have applications in most industries, we have little doubt that mainstream adoption will continue to grow.\\nOrganizations shouldn’t focus too heavily on the trends that are garnering the most attention. By focusing on only the most hyped trends, they may miss out on the significant value potential of other technologies and hinder the chance for purposeful capability building. Instead, companies seeking longer-term growth should focus on a portfolio-oriented investment across the tech trends most important to their business. Technologies such as cloud and edge computing and the future of bioengineering have shown steady increases in innovation and continue to have expanded use cases across industries. In fact, more than 400 edge use cases across various industries have been identified, and edge computing is projected to win double-digit growth globally over the next five years. Additionally, nascent technologies, such as quantum, continue to evolve and show significant potential for value creation. Our updated analysis for 2023 shows that the four industries likely to see the earliest economic impact from quantum computing—automotive, chemicals, financial services, and life sciences—stand to potentially gain up to $1.3 trillion in value by 2035. By carefully assessing the evolving landscape and considering a balanced approach, businesses can capitalize on both established and emerging technologies to propel innovation and achieve sustainable growth.\\nTech talent dynamics\\nWe can’t overstate the importance of talent as a key source in developing a competitive edge. A lack of talent is a top issue constraining growth. There’s a wide gap between the demand for people with the skills needed to capture value from the tech trends and available talent: our survey of 3.5 million job postings in these tech trends found that many of the skills in greatest demand have less than half as many qualified practitioners per posting as the global average. Companies should be on top of the talent market, ready to respond to notable shifts and to deliver a strong value proposition to the technologists they hope to hire and retain. For instance, recent layoffs in the tech sector may present a silver lining for other industries that have struggled to win the attention of attractive candidates and retain senior tech talent. In addition, some of these technologies will accelerate the pace of workforce transformation. In the coming decade, 20 to 30 percent of the time that workers spend on the job could be transformed by automation technologies, leading to significant shifts in the skills required to be successful. And companies should continue to look at how they can adjust roles or upskill individuals to meet their tailored job requirements. Job postings in fields related to tech trends grew at a very healthy 15 percent between 2021 and 2022, even though global job postings overall decreased by 13 percent. Applied AI and next-generation software development together posted nearly one million jobs between 2018 and 2022. Next-generation software development saw the most significant growth in number of jobs (exhibit).\\n\\n\\nImage description:\\nSmall multiples of 15 slope charts show the number of job postings in different fields related to tech trends from 2021 to 2022. Overall growth of all fields combined was about 400,000 jobs, with applied AI having the most job postings in 2022 and experiencing a 6% increase from 2021. Next-generation software development had the second-highest number of job postings in 2022 and had 29% growth from 2021. Other categories shown, from most job postings to least in 2022, are as follows: cloud and edge computing, trust architecture and digital identity, future of mobility, electrification and renewables, climate tech beyond electrification and renewables, advanced connectivity, immersive-reality technologies, industrializing machine learning, Web3, future of bioengineering, future of space technologies, generative AI, and quantum technologies.\\nEnd of image description.\\nThis bright outlook for practitioners in most fields highlights the challenge facing employers who are struggling to find enough talent to keep up with their demands. The shortage of qualified talent has been a persistent limiting factor in the growth of many high-tech fields, including AI, quantum technologies, space technologies, and electrification and renewables. The talent crunch is particularly pronounced for trends such as cloud computing and industrializing machine learning, which are required across most industries. It’s also a major challenge in areas that employ highly specialized professionals, such as the future of mobility and quantum computing (see interactive).\\nMichael Chui is a McKinsey Global Institute partner in McKinsey’s Bay Area office, where Mena Issler is an associate partner, Roger Roberts\\xa0is a partner, and Lareina Yee\\xa0is a senior partner.\\nThe authors wish to thank the following McKinsey colleagues for their contributions to this research: Bharat Bahl, Soumya Banerjee, Arjita Bhan, Tanmay Bhatnagar, Jim Boehm, Andreas Breiter, Tom Brennan, Ryan Brukardt, Kevin Buehler, Zina Cole, Santiago Comella-Dorda, Brian Constantine, Daniela Cuneo, Wendy Cyffka, Chris Daehnick, Ian De Bode, Andrea Del Miglio, Jonathan DePrizio, Ivan Dyakonov, Torgyn Erland, Robin Giesbrecht, Carlo Giovine, Liz Grennan, Ferry Grijpink, Harsh Gupta, Martin Harrysson, David Harvey, Kersten Heineke, Matt Higginson, Alharith Hussin, Tore Johnston, Philipp Kampshoff, Hamza Khan, Nayur Khan, Naomi Kim, Jesse Klempner, Kelly Kochanski, Matej Macak, Stephanie Madner, Aishwarya Mohapatra, Timo Möller, Matt Mrozek, Evan Nazareth, Peter Noteboom, Anna Orthofer, Katherine Ottenbreit, Eric Parsonnet, Mark Patel, Bruce Philp, Fabian Queder, Robin Riedel, Tanya Rodchenko, Lucy Shenton, Henning Soller, Naveen Srikakulam, Shivam Srivastava, Bhargs Srivathsan, Erika Stanzl, Brooke Stokes, Malin Strandell-Jansson, Daniel Wallance, Allen Weinberg, Olivia White, Martin Wrulich, Perez Yeptho, Matija Zesko, Felix Ziegler, and Delphine Zurkiya.\\nThey also wish to thank the external members of the McKinsey Technology Council.\\n\\nThis interactive was designed, developed, and edited by McKinsey Global Publishing’s Nayomi Chibana, Victor Cuevas, Richard Johnson, Stephanie Jones, Stephen Landau, LaShon Malone, Kanika Punwani, Katie Shearer, Rick Tetzeli, Sneha Vats, and Jessica Wang.\\nExplore a career with us\\nSearch Openings\\nRelated Articles\\n\\nInteractive\\nMcKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2022\\n\\nInteractive\\nValue creation in the metaverse\\n\\nArticle\\nQuantum computing funding remains strong, but talent gap raises concern'}]\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI have gathered information about the latest trends for 2023, which include advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), sustainability technologies, and the metaverse.

Boho Chic In Suede\\nSuede is on track to be a standout for Spring/Summer 2025, on everything from accessories as larger bags to skirts and outerwear. In addition, we can expect to see a growth in matching sets as well, a suede blazer paired with a suede skirt or trousers.\\nThe men\\'s SS25 shows already hinted at this trend, showcasing a 13% increase in matching sets on the runway. For women, the suede fabric in general is expected to grow with +17% among women between July-September compared to the previous year. And it doesn’t stop there, for the beginning of 2025 is suede loafers expected to increase with +30%, mainly adopted by the edgy consumer. The whole bohemian, relaxed yet sophisticated trend will have its return and suede will be the key player for this!\\n\\n1. Ralph Lauren / 2. 16Arlington / 3. Marni\\n2. Yellow Yellow Yellow\\n\\n\\nAlaïa SS25\\n\\nThe color that never fails to radiate—Yellow! From soft, creamy vanilla yellow to the bold richness of saffron, this vibrant hue is set to make waves in Spring/Summer 2025. Vanilla yellow trend is projected to rise by +11%, while saffron yellow will see a +6% increase from April to June, compared to previous years.\\nDownload our Women\\'s Spring/Summer \\'25 Fashion Weeks Report\\n3. Hot Pants as The New Mini Skirt\\nHot pants have emerged as the new alternative to the mini skirt, styled either with bare legs or paired with stockings. On the runway for this season it was featured in fabrics like cotton, knit, sequin, denim, and leather. The shape can be styled in various ways and is either worn with party tops or cozy knitted cardigans. This fashion style is expected to see a +7% increase in popularity from April to June 2025 compared to previous year. For July to September, the shape is forecasted to have a +14% increase particularly embraced by trendy Gen Z consumers.\\n\\nFendi SS25\\n4. Aquatic Wonderland\\nWe can expect aquatic influences in 2025 that go beyond the classic nautical marine aesthetic, instead the inspiration will take us deep into the world of water and everything that exists within it. Think vibrant tiles from a pool, tropical blues that evoke the soothing depths of the ocean, the caudal fin, the shells of aquatic animals, and mermaid-inspired dresses.\\nFor Spring/Summer 2025, we anticipate a trend centered around aquatic influences to evolve. This is indeed a theme for the more edgy, fashion-forward consumer, infused with a touch of fashion extravagance. However, we can also expect to see these influences among mainstream consumers, playing with shades of blue and metallic colors alongside lustrous fabrics. For summer 2025, turquoise is forecasted to increase by +8% compared to the previous summer, while mermaid-inspired elements like sequins and fishtail maxi dresses are expected to grow by +20% and +17%, respectively.\\n\\n1.

Think about effortless more cute elegance with a sporty edge. On the runways, brands like Casablanca and Ferragamo reinterpreted activewear in luxurious fabrics and playful color palettes, placing a spotlight on the feminine side of sports fashion. Sweatpants, which are estimated to see a +25% increase for Spring \\'25 compared to the previous year, are being styled with heels and bags to give off an effortless \"on-the-go\" vibe.\\xa0\\n\\n1.

The Feminine Polo Shirt\\nThis year\\'s runway showcased a more tailored, feminine-fit polo with short sleeves, giving a slightly posh touch to outfits. These polos were often styled buttoned up, adding structure to the overall look. For decades, the polo shirt has been a symbol of casual sophistication in men’s fashion. However, in recent years, this iconic piece has made a stylish shift, becoming just as essential in women\\'s fashion, but with a decidedly feminine twist. No longer confined to its traditional, boxy silhouette, the polo shirt is being reimagined for women with a modern, fitted cut that accentuates the female form. Designers during Spring/Summer 2025 were blending classic elements, like the signature collar and buttoned placket with new shapes and fabrics that elevate the garment from its sporty roots.\\nSlimmer fits, cropped versions, and softer fabrics like ribbed knits and stretch cottons will make the polo shirt shine during 2025. In Europe, during Jan-March 2025, the popularity of Polo shirts is expected to rise by +22% compared to the previous. Later on (April-June) the Short Sleeved Polo is expected to increase +11% and mainly adopted by the mainstream consumer.\\n7. Animal Print\\nFor some fashion people, Leopard print is less of a trend and more of a timeless staple. But in 2024, it dominated our feeds, splashed across everything from interiors to clothing, enjoying a major resurgence in visibility.

Chet Lo SS25\\nOne-leg pants, flowy skirts, and one-shoulder tops are all fantastic examples of how asymmetry can elevate fashion pieces to new heights, making garments feel both fresh and contemporary.

Animal prints are set to become the season\\'s rising stars, with a projected +92% increase from July to September. During the same time period, Leopard and tiger prints, in particular, will shine and is forecasted to surge by +138% and +16%, respectively.\\n\\n1. Ganni / 2. Marcia\\n8. Thong Sandals\\nFlip flops paired with jeans have long been a signature look among the style-savvy in Copenhagen, and this laid-back aesthetic will gain traction across the rest of Europe in 2025. Thong sandals are stepping into the spotlight, and was seen on the runway in various shows as Dior, Burberry and Etro.\\nAccording to data from Heuritech, the popularity of Thong Sandals is set to soar by an impressive +25% (April-June)\\nDuring the same period and even more striking is the projected +31% increase in rubber thong sandals, mostly driven by the edgy consumer.\\n9. Strapless Dress\\nStrapless dresses made a striking comeback on the Spring Summer 2025 runways, blending minimalist charm with bold new textures. Acne Studios showcased a heart-shaped neckline that created an exaggerated silhouette, adding a playful twist to classic black. MM6 Maison Margiela embraced a deconstructed approach, with ruched details giving an edgy twist to the strapless form. At LaQuan Smith, snake-print strapless designs lent a sultry allure, highlighting the trend’s versatile appeal.\\nDuring Spring 2025 (April-June), strapless dresses will increase with +15% and cater to the edgy and trendy consumer with effortless grace.\\n10. All about Asymmetry\\n\\n1. Bottega Veneta SS25 / 2. ALAÏA SS25 / 3. Chet Lo SS25\\nOne-leg pants, flowy skirts, and one-shoulder tops are all fantastic examples of how asymmetry can elevate fashion pieces to new heights, making garments feel both fresh and contemporary. The design introduces an interesting, unique cut to more traditional shapes, and in 2025, we can expect to see even more of this trend.\\nIn Spring 2025 (April-June), asymmetric neck woven tops are estimated to increase by +6%, with significant adoption mainly among Gen Z and Millennials. During the same period, the asymmetric neck t-shirt is projected to grow by +10%, primarily driven by mainstream consumers, indicating great commercial potential.\\nSee our market reports\\n\\nGet contacted by one of our experts\\nBlending artificial intelligence with fashion expertise for predictive analytics on trends\\nFASHION TRENDS\\nEVENTS\\nWEBINARS\\nCAREERS\\nPRICING\\nFAQ\\nCAREERS\\nPRICING\\nFAQ\\nPRESS\\nPress inquiries: press@heuritech.com\\nNewsletter\\n© 2024 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED - HEURITECH |\\xa0 PRIVACY POLICY |\\xa0TERMS & CONDITIONS\\xa0| 66 avenue des Champs-Élysées, 75008 Paris, France'}, {'title': 'The 2025 Fashion Trends Taking Shape in Real Time | Marie Claire', 'url': 'https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/fashion-trends-2025/', 'content': 'Nostalgia will continue to dominate the trend landscape in 2025, just as it did in 2024.

While last year didn\\'t entirely snuff out quiet luxury, it put us on a pendulum swing in the opposite direction—and in a fever-pitch pursuit of personal style.\\nWe craved individuality in our closets and wanted items that championed it. Barn jackets—both Carhartt\\'s $90 canvas classics and Prada\\'s $4,000 purposely worn workwear coats—became a way to escape regular life and role-play as a hay-baler in the English countryside. Bubble skirts brought frothy, coquettish cuteness, and Charli XCX\\'s brat green was a provocative sucker punch.\\nEven the items that still whispered \"stealth wealth\" had something more interesting to say than \"if you know, you know\". For instance, the suede bag trend that was everywhere last fall (see Coach\\'s viral Brooklyn) was a harbinger of a bigger boho-chic comeback.\\nWhile it\\'s impossible to know exactly what we\\'ll wear over the coming 12 months, we can make some good educated guesses. Here, Marie Claire draws inspiration from the Spring 2025 trends unveiled on last September\\'s runways and consults fashion experts and analysts to uncover what’s next for fashion in 2025.\\nSea La Vie\\nWhen it comes to the products Marie Claire recommends, we take your faith in us seriously.

The Vogue alum points to Miu Miu\\'s Spring 2025 show, where models sported intentionally chipped, flaky nails, as well as Gucci and Bottega\\'s paparazzi-style campaigns and Balenciaga\\'s iPhone-shot ads—complete with a finger smudge on the lens.\\nWhat does the \"realification of fashion\" mean for the clothes we’ll actually wear? \"Think softer fabrics, relaxed silhouettes, and a redefinition of sexiness. It’s no longer about trussing ourselves into clothes that make us feel alien or uncomfortable,\" says Rachel Solomon, author of the style Substack Hey, Mrs. Solomon. Instead, it\\'s a mindset shift toward \"investing in pieces we genuinely wear, rather than splurging on items for an imagined lifestyle,\" she explains.\\n\\nBarbour Beatrix Longline Trench Coat\\n$440 at Saks Fifth Avenue\\n\\nToteme Gathered Stretch-Jersey Midi Dress\\n$690 at Net-a-Porter\\n\\nTory Burch Apron Toe Loafers\\n$298 at Bloomingdale\\'s\\nBoho 2.0\\n\\nThe boho boom, as evidenced by Balenciaga\\'s Le City Bag relaunch, Isabel Marant, Chloe, and Ralph Lauren\\'s Spring 2025 shows.\\n(Image credit: Future)\\nLike a rolling stone, bohemian fashion keeps on keeping on.\\n\"For 2025, boho chic makes a polished comeback, moving beyond last season’s rugged vintage vibe,\" says Voyer. \"This season emphasizes romantic, feminine silhouettes that feel effortless yet intentional.\" She highlights Chemena Kamal\\'s fresh, modern approach at Chloé and Gen Z’s knack for vintage shopping as key factors breathing new life into the aesthetic.

She notes this shift is reflected in \"extra-special details that redefine luxury through unique touches and added flair,\" like incorporating statement pieces into everyday wear or investing in standout items like the season’s best cargo pants. \"Ultimately, the power lies in thoughtful, functional, or playful details that elevate the overall experience of a piece.\"\\nJoanne Thomas, Fashion Snoops’ director of color, highlights the rise of \"superimposed pastels\" in 2025. She describes \"blues that exude quiet charm and bouncy mints with a fizzy freshness that invigorates the senses.\" These hues provide a playful yet calming escape from the everyday. In contrast, she notes, \"a unique blend of grey and beige will ground the year in simplicity and stability.\"\\n\\nGuest in Residence Cloud Wool-Blend Crewneck Sweater\\n$395 at Saks Fifth Avenue\\n\\nPrada Eternal Gold Bow Signet Ring - Yellow Gold\\n$2,800 at Prada\\n\\nBaserange Blue Dydine Maxi Skirt\\n$165 at SSENSE\\nPower Rewired\\n\\nNeo-power pieces in Paris Fashion Week street style and on Tory Burch, Brandon Maxwell, Coach, and Paco Rabanne\\'s runways.\\n(Image credit: Future)\\nThis year will also demonstrate Gen Z\\'s prowess as taste-makers. Voyer predicts Zoomers will \"redefine power dressing and officewear with a rebellious flair. Think rock and grunge influences fused with vintage luxury pieces, sportswear, and streetwear, much like the Spring 205 collections of Coach, Prada, Rabanne, and Willy Chavarria. This bold fusion of eras and styles sets the stage for a year of self-expression and redefined fashion codes in what Voyer calls a \\'power rewired\\' aesthetic. Key pieces include baggy jeans, front-crease tailored trousers, hourglass blazers, and hot pants.\\n\\nAgolde Low Slung Baggy Jeans\\n$160 at Nordstrom\\n\\nBabaton Standout Blazer\\n$248 at Aritzia\\n\\nFavorite Daughter The Favorite Pant\\n$228 at Revolve\\nGood Bad Taste\\n\\nExpressive fashion peacocking shown in Copenhagen and Paris Fashion Week\\'s street style and Loewe, Dries Van Noten, Prada, and Saint Laurent\\'s Spring 2025 shows.\\n(Image credit: Future)\\nNoora Raj Brown, executive vice president at Goop and author of the shopping Substack Objects of Desire, predicts \"a shift away from years of minimalism and muted tones toward unbridled expressions of personal taste. Some of that expression will be objectively \"bad\" [going against unconventional good taste].\" By that, I mean it won’t be as polished or put-together—but it will be more interesting, with room for creativity.\"\\nBrown sees this \"so-bad-it’s-good\" trend reflected in extremes: \"oversized proportions, elegant voluminous coats, and flowing trousers on one end, and short skirts, sheer fabrics, and lingerie-inspired pieces on the other.\"\\nVoyer agrees, pointing to controversial shoes like Maison Margiela’s split-toe Tabi shoes and eclectic, mismatched layering outfits as \"conversation-starting details.\" On the color front, Fashion Snoops’ Thomas foresees \"bold, fiery reds and near-neon oranges injecting dynamic energy and celebrating fearless self-expression.\"\\n\\nDries Van Noten Homoa Polka Dot Mesh Skirt\\n$297 at Saks Fifth Avenue\\n\\nMaison MargielaTabi Ballerina Flat\\n$995 at Nordstrom\\n\\nAligne Allanah Puff Sleeve Top\\n$165 at Shopbop\\nLet\\'s Move!\\n\\nA sporty style sentiment seen at Off-White, Christian Dior, Miu Miu, Ferragamo, Aläia.\\n(Image credit: Future)\\nAs community-oriented sports groups and activities like run clubs, yoga, and pilates become more central in people’s lives, so will workout wear, explains Voyer. “As a result, athleticwear designed for versatility becomes relevant, driving demand for pieces that seamlessly transition from workouts to daily life,” she says.\\nVoyer references asymmetrical cropped tops that look closer to regular shirts than sports bras, an example of the subtle shift that equally values fashion and function. Looking ahead, the trend expert anticipates a more delicate color palette, like soft yellows and baby pinks, track pants, Capri-length leggings, and mini bike shorts defining the category.\\n\\nAdidas x Wales Bonner Three-Stripe Track Pants\\n$250 at Saks Fifth Avenue\\n\\nOn Cloudmonster Running Shoe\\n$170 at Nordstrom\\n\\nAdidas + Y-3 Asymmetric Striped Stretch Jersey-Trimmed Brushed Recycled-Mesh Tank\\n$230 at Net-a-Porter\\nChildlike Comfort\\n\\nKitschy accessories seen at Copenhagen Fashion Week and Coach and Marco Rambaldi Spring 2025 show.\\n(Image credit: Future)\\nNostalgia will continue to dominate the trend landscape in 2025, just as it did in 2024.

Some of that expression will be objectively \"bad\" [going against unconventional good taste].\" By that, I mean it won’t be as polished or put-together—but it will be more interesting, with room for creativity.\"\\nBrown sees this \"so-bad-it’s-good\" trend reflected in extremes: \"oversized proportions, elegant voluminous coats, and flowing trousers on one end, and short skirts, sheer fabrics, and lingerie-inspired pieces on the other.\"\\nVoyer agrees, pointing to controversial shoes like Maison Margiela’s split-toe Tabi shoes and eclectic, mismatched layering outfits as \"conversation-starting details.\" On the color front, Fashion Snoops’ Thomas foresees \"bold, fiery reds and near-neon oranges injecting dynamic energy and celebrating fearless self-expression.\"\\n\\nDries Van Noten Homoa Polka Dot Mesh Skirt\\n$297 at Saks Fifth Avenue\\n\\nMaison MargielaTabi Ballerina Flat\\n$995 at Nordstrom\\n\\nAligne Allanah Puff Sleeve Top\\n$165 at Shopbop\\nLet\\'s Move!\\n\\nA sporty style sentiment seen at Off-White, Christian Dior, Miu Miu, Ferragamo, Aläia.\\n(Image credit: Future)\\nAs community-oriented sports groups and activities like run clubs, yoga, and pilates become more central in people’s lives, so will workout wear, explains Voyer. “As a result, athleticwear designed for versatility becomes relevant, driving demand for pieces that seamlessly transition from workouts to daily life,” she says.\\nVoyer references asymmetrical cropped tops that look closer to regular shirts than sports bras, an example of the subtle shift that equally values fashion and function. Looking ahead, the trend expert anticipates a more delicate color palette, like soft yellows and baby pinks, track pants, Capri-length leggings, and mini bike shorts defining the category.\\n\\nAdidas x Wales Bonner Three-Stripe Track Pants\\n$250 at Saks Fifth Avenue\\n\\nOn Cloudmonster Running Shoe\\n$170 at Nordstrom\\n\\nAdidas + Y-3 Asymmetric Striped Stretch Jersey-Trimmed Brushed Recycled-Mesh Tank\\n$230 at Net-a-Porter\\nChildlike Comfort\\n\\nKitschy accessories seen at Copenhagen Fashion Week and Coach and Marco Rambaldi Spring 2025 show.\\n(Image credit: Future)\\nNostalgia will continue to dominate the trend landscape in 2025, just as it did in 2024. Jessie Randall, designer, founder, and creative director of Loeffler Randall and author of Substack Jessie Loves, is “seeing the appetite for childhood-inspired styles continually grow—like the ballet flats and Mary Janes that remind you of your first dance lessons, and loafers and boat shoes that recall old-school prep.”\\nRandall also predicts a comeback for last summer’s jelly sandal trend: \"Our jelly sandals sold out faster than any silhouette we’ve ever designed, and I believe they’ll be just as big in Spring ’25.\"\\nVoyer adds that personalized accessories—such as bag charms and stuffed animal keychains—will continue to grow in popularity. \"As consumers focus on building versatile, durable wardrobes, they’ll use accessories to add a touch of individuality to classic outfits,\" she notes.\\n\\nVictoria\\'s Secret Pink Micro Dog Keychain Charm\\n$17 at Victoria\\'s Secret\\n\\nLoeffler Randall Leonie Bow-Embellished Suede Ballet Flats\\n$310 at Net-a-Porter\\n\\nRoxanne Assoulin Lucky Charms Necklace\\n$120 at Shopbop\\nTOPICS\\nshoes\\nStay In The Know\\nGet exclusive access to fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.\\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\\n\\nEmma Childs\\nSocial Links Navigation\\n\\nFashion Features Editor\\nEmma is the fashion features editor at Marie Claire, where she explores the intersection of style and human interest storytelling.

Rooted in a sense of “soft power,” which Vogue’s Laird Borelli-Persson connected to designers encouraging “an openness to a sense of wonder” in her analysis of the shows, these trends can be embraced in more ways than one. And key themes can already be incorporated into your wardrobe.\\nConsider spring’s outerwear stories, which reimagine lightweight jackets of all types, particularly sporty styles for the season ahead. For inspiration on how to wear these jackets from now, look no further than Bottega, where an elasticated windbreaker was styled with fluid trousers. A zip-up à la Gucci works equally well here—just throw an overcoat on top. Suede will continue to trend as well, so if you invested this fall, keep wearing it! At Prada, caramel suede was paired with dark grey—a new go-to winter color combo to try in the new year.\\nSpeaking of the new year, it’s the perfect opportunity to refresh your work staples. For the office and beyond, we’ll be seeing new takes on tailoring—both oversized and shrunken—to suit your 2025 style resolutions. There are plenty of relaxed suiting options to add to your rotation right now—make it full look for that inimitable Saint Laurent swagger.\\nAs for the print that reigned supreme on the spring/summer runways? It wasn’t a floral or an animal but plaid. The autumnal pattern was already a favorite this fall, but it seems like fashion wasn’t done with it for spring, rendering it in softer colors and shapes. If plaid was already a trend you incorporated this season, look to the runways for ideas on how to print clash—we saw it styled as full ensembles in various checks, but also contrasted with polkadots and stripes.\\nBelow, a look at the three key spring/summer 2025 fashion trends you can wear now—a running list we’ll continue to update as spring’s coveted deliveries land in stores.\\nRunway: Loewe Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025; Prada Spring 2025; Miu Miu Spring 2025; Gucci Spring 2025\\nPhotos: Courtesy of GoRunway.com\\nSpring Outerwear Stories\\nA sporty sensibility carried over from fashion’s Olympics fervor pervaded the spring/summer 2025 runways. Sabato de Sarno showed various fitted zip-up jackets at Gucci, while Bottega and Miu Miu reimagined the wind breaker—Matthieu Blazy notably lined his in plaid, a carryover from fall we’ll get into next. But other kinds of lightweight outerwear were anlso introduced. At Prada, Miuccia and Raf Simons showed a suede style, proof that fashion’s ongoing obsession with the texture isn’t going anywhere. A cropped leather cape made an appearance at Loewe, upleveling the boho staple we were reacquainted with last spring.

Borelli-Persson described these checks best as “Nirvana meets Country Living… for any season or type of weather” in her trend report. The Row’s ‘Tavishina’ coat in look 29 exemplifies the fashion mood, with an energizing combination of beige, black, and baby blue squares that was styled with pinstripe pants and a plain white button-up for a harmonious, minimalist-approved take on print mixing. Blazy meanwhile played with a classic color scheme of browns, greys, and white, but showed it as an oversized shacket meets coat hybrid. At Tod’s checks were playfully introduced once more, worn inside out as a full ensemble. In New York, Daniella Kallmeyer furthered the artful drape with a fluid blouse, while Acne Studios dabbled in the art of the clash (nails included!) and incorporated another theme seen in the resort 2025 trends: the bubble hem. This ’90s-inspired look can be achieved now with printed pieces from the likes of Massimo Dutti, Ralph Lauren, or Zara—and styled with pattern opposites for a true runway-coded look.\\n\\nBottega Veneta\\nchecked cotton trench coat\\n$3,900BOTTEGA VENETA\\n\\nDries Van Noten\\ngathered checked crepe maxi dress\\n$2,110NET-A-PORTER\\n\\nRalph Lauren\\nplaid cotton twill workshirt\\n$168RALPH LAUREN\\n\\nMassimo Dutti\\ndraped neck check shirt\\n$120MASSIMO DUTTI\\n\\nAcne Studios\\nsingle-breasted coat\\n$2,150MYTHERESA\\n$2,150SSENSE\\n\\nZara\\nplaid flannel shirt\\n$46ZARA\\nRunway: Tory Burch Spring 2025; Stella McCartney Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025; Saint Laurent Spring 2025; Bally Spring 2025\\nPhotos: Courtesy of GoRunway.com\\nNew Business Codes\\nWe’re leaving the office siren behind for spring, and embracing new tailoring codes for 2025.

And key themes can already be incorporated into your wardrobe.\\nConsider spring’s outerwear stories, which reimagine lightweight jackets of all types, particularly sporty styles for the season ahead. For inspiration on how to wear these jackets from now, look no further than Bottega, where an elasticated windbreaker was styled with fluid trousers. A zip-up à la Gucci works equally well here—just throw an overcoat on top. Suede will continue to trend as well, so if you invested this fall, keep wearing it! At Prada, caramel suede was paired with dark grey—a new go-to winter color combo to try in the new year.\\nSpeaking of the new year, it’s the perfect opportunity to refresh your work staples. For the office and beyond, we’ll be seeing new takes on tailoring—both oversized and shrunken—to suit your 2025 style resolutions. There are plenty of relaxed suiting options to add to your rotation right now—make it full look for that inimitable Saint Laurent swagger.\\nAs for the print that reigned supreme on the spring/summer runways? It wasn’t a floral or an animal but plaid. The autumnal pattern was already a favorite this fall, but it seems like fashion wasn’t done with it for spring, rendering it in softer colors and shapes. If plaid was already a trend you incorporated this season, look to the runways for ideas on how to print clash—we saw it styled as full ensembles in various checks, but also contrasted with polkadots and stripes.\\nBelow, a look at the three key spring/summer 2025 fashion trends you can wear now—a running list we’ll continue to update as spring’s coveted deliveries land in stores.\\nRunway: Loewe Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025; Prada Spring 2025; Miu Miu Spring 2025; Gucci Spring 2025\\nPhotos: Courtesy of GoRunway.com\\nSpring Outerwear Stories\\nA sporty sensibility carried over from fashion’s Olympics fervor pervaded the spring/summer 2025 runways.

Chanel's recent Pre-Fall 25 collection took a similar approach, showcasing metallic gold from head to toe, feathers, supple satin, and lots of jewelry. All in all, the runways proved that excess, glamour, and opulence will reign in the year ahead. According to the Instagram account [...] Though this trend has been slowly creeping up for a few seasons now, Saint Laurent's S/S 25 collection really put it on the map. We're calling it a few different things, including soft power and power play, but generally speaking, it's fashion's move toward a softer version of workwear that isn't as sharp and tailored as it's been in the past. Suits are slightly more relaxed and oversize and styled personally with cuff bracelets, oversize sunglasses, and interesting outerwear. The trend [...] If 2024 was all about red, from traditional to burgundy, 2025 will be centered on pale pink, and it's not just because it's Glinda Upland's favorite color. (Though, Ariana Grande's insistence on wearing the soft shade throughout Wicked's press tour certainly didn't hurt its cause.) Pink's return to fashion fame after a brief hiatus following Barbie came about thanks to brands like Alaïa, Brandon Maxwell, and Khaite, all of which heavily featured it in their spring/summer 2025 collections.\", 'score': 0.8387567429063361, 'raw_content': 'These Are the 7 Most Important 2025 Fashion Trends | Who What Wear\\n Who What Wear\\nUS Edition\\n\\n\\nUS\\n\\nAustralia\\n\\nUK\\nshop with isa\\nSubscribe\\n×\\nSearch\\nshop with isa\\n\\n\\nTrends Trends\\n\\n\\nsub-nav-trends [ ]  sub-nav-trends\\n        *   View all Trends\\n        *   Spring\\n        *   Summer\\n        *   Fall\\n        *   Winter\\n        *   Runway\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOutfits Outfits\\n\\n\\nsub-nav-outfits [ ]  sub-nav-outfits\\n        *   View all Outfits\\n        *   Airport Style\\n        *   Office\\n        *   Street Style\\n        *   Vacation\\n        *   Party\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShopping Shopping\\n\\n\\nsub-nav-shopping-guides [ ]  sub-nav-shopping-guides\\n        *   View all Shopping\\n        *   Denim\\n        *   Dresses\\n        *   Handbags\\n        *   Shoes\\n        *   Luxury\\n        *   Basics\\n        *   Jewelry\\n        *   Under $100\\n        *   Swim\\n        *   Lingerie\\n        *   Promo Codes\\n        *   Livestream Shopping\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeauty Beauty\\n\\n\\nsub-nav-beauty [ ]  sub-nav-beauty\\n        *   View all Beauty\\n        *   Hair\\n        *   Skin\\n        *   Makeup\\n        *   Nails\\n        *   Fragrance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLiving Living\\n\\n\\nsub-nav-living [ ]  sub-nav-living\\n        *   View all Living\\n        *   Travel\\n        *   Home\\n        *   Wedding\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPodcast Podcast\\n\\n\\n\\nsub-nav-podcast [ ]  sub-nav-podcast\\n        *   View all Podcast\\n        *   Who What Wear Podcast\\n        *   Second Life\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNEWSLETTER\\n\\n\\n\\nNo offers found\\n\\nHome\\nFashion\\nTrends\\n\\nSupported\\nThe Forecast: This Is What 2025 Fashion Will Look Like\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNEWSLETTER\\n\\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.\\n\\n(Image credit: @stephaniebroek; @hannamw; Launchmetrics Spotlight; Backgrid; Courtesy of The New Arrivals: Ilkyaz Ozel; Gilbert Carrasquillo/GC Images/Getty Images)\\nBy Eliza Huber\\npublished 17 December 2024\\nin Features\\nExactly 377 days ago, I wrote the 2024 version of this exact story and started by discussing the ever-changing fashion environment throughout the year prior. Back then, I was excited about the possibilities surrounding some of the industry\\'s more recent creative-director hires—including designers Matthieu Blazy at Bottega Veneta (Blazy started in 2020) and Louise Trotter at Carven. (Trotter started in 2023.) Changes were happening at major houses, new legacies were being built, and excitement was in the air. Little did I know then that 2024 would bring about even more variation. Just last week, Trotter announced her departure from Carven, followed by Blazy at Bottega Veneta. The Italian leather goods brand then named Trotter as Blazy\\'s successor. A few hours later, Chanel answered every fashion person\\'s most burning question: Who will take over from Virginie Viard? The answer was Blazy. That\\'s only two of the industry\\'s many swapped seats this year.\\nSuffice it to say, 2025 is on track to blow 2024\\'s chaotic and unpredictable energy out of the water, but that doesn\\'t mean we must go into the year completely blind. After studying the spring/summer 2025 runway collections and end-of-year culture shifts, I feel confident about my predictions about what\\'s to come in the next 365 days or so. Below, read up on 2025 fashion before the year even begins, from 180-degree aesthetic changes to fresh color trends.\\n\\n(Image credit: TheStewartofNY/GC Images/Getty Images; @hoskelsa; Launchmetrics Spotlight; @fannyekstrand; MEGA/GC Images/Getty Images)\\nThough this trend has been slowly creeping up for a few seasons now, Saint Laurent\\'s S/S 25 collection really put it on the map. We\\'re calling it a few different things, including soft power and power play, but generally speaking, it\\'s fashion\\'s move toward a softer version of workwear that isn\\'t as sharp and tailored as it\\'s been in the past. Suits are slightly more relaxed and oversize and styled personally with cuff bracelets, oversize sunglasses, and interesting outerwear. The trend extended to Bottega Veneta, Stella McCartney, and Christopher Esber. In a press release following Louis Vuitton\\'s show during Paris Fashion Week, the house\\'s creative director Nicolas Ghesquière called soft power the ultimate oxymoron given that softness and power are often seen as opposites. However, where they meet is really where successful women reside. They\\'re multifaceted beings who are able to balance the two contrasting concepts naturally.\\nGoing into 2025, expect this new corporate aesthetic to hit the streets more and more. We\\'ve already seen Saint Laurent\\'s versions on Hailey Bieber and Rosé, but there will, no doubt, be unique takes hitting our social media feeds everywhere very soon. To help you out, here\\'s a tutorial on how to tie a tie. You\\'ll need it.\\n\\nZARA\\nStriped Silk-Viscose Tie\\n$46\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nZARA\\n100% Wool Jacket\\n$139\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nMiu Miu\\nRegard Sunglasses\\n$505\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\n(Image credit: John Nacion/Getty Images; Taylor Hill/WireImage; Gilbert Carrasquillo/GC Images/Getty Images; Courtesy of Prada; Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic/Getty Images; Gilbert Carrasquillo/GC Images/Getty Images; Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images)\\nI recently attended the Shark Beauty Women\\'s Champions Classic, a two-game NCAA basketball event at Barclays Center, and the turnout for the second game of the night between the University of Connecticut (UConn) Huskies and the University of Louisville Cardinals was unlike anything I\\'ve ever seen. The place was packed, especially with women and girls, many of whom wore one specific T-shirt (unless they were wearing merch for UConn star player and Nike athlete Paige Bueckers) by the brand Togethxr. The tee is simple with four words printed on the front in all caps: Everyone watches women\\'s sports.\\nThat T-shirt says it all. According to a report published this month by Morning Consult, an American intelligence company, the WNBA was 2024\\'s fastest-growing brand among all U.S. adults. It was the first time since the company was founded in 2014 that a sports league ranked first on this list. According to StubHub, ticket sales were up nearly 10 times in 2024 compared to 2023 before the season even began. \"This year\\'s NCAA Women\\'s Final Four and the WNBA Finals were the best-selling in StubHub history,\" the company published in a recent report.

Back then, I was excited about the possibilities surrounding some of the industry\\'s more recent creative-director hires—including designers Matthieu Blazy at Bottega Veneta (Blazy started in 2020) and Louise Trotter at Carven. (Trotter started in 2023.) Changes were happening at major houses, new legacies were being built, and excitement was in the air. Little did I know then that 2024 would bring about even more variation. Just last week, Trotter announced her departure from Carven, followed by Blazy at Bottega Veneta. The Italian leather goods brand then named Trotter as Blazy\\'s successor. A few hours later, Chanel answered every fashion person\\'s most burning question: Who will take over from Virginie Viard? The answer was Blazy. That\\'s only two of the industry\\'s many swapped seats this year.\\nSuffice it to say, 2025 is on track to blow 2024\\'s chaotic and unpredictable energy out of the water, but that doesn\\'t mean we must go into the year completely blind. After studying the spring/summer 2025 runway collections and end-of-year culture shifts, I feel confident about my predictions about what\\'s to come in the next 365 days or so. Below, read up on 2025 fashion before the year even begins, from 180-degree aesthetic changes to fresh color trends.\\n\\n(Image credit: TheStewartofNY/GC Images/Getty Images; @hoskelsa; Launchmetrics Spotlight; @fannyekstrand; MEGA/GC Images/Getty Images)\\nThough this trend has been slowly creeping up for a few seasons now, Saint Laurent\\'s S/S 25 collection really put it on the map. We\\'re calling it a few different things, including soft power and power play, but generally speaking, it\\'s fashion\\'s move toward a softer version of workwear that isn\\'t as sharp and tailored as it\\'s been in the past. Suits are slightly more relaxed and oversize and styled personally with cuff bracelets, oversize sunglasses, and interesting outerwear. The trend extended to Bottega Veneta, Stella McCartney, and Christopher Esber. In a press release following Louis Vuitton\\'s show during Paris Fashion Week, the house\\'s creative director Nicolas Ghesquière called soft power the ultimate oxymoron given that softness and power are often seen as opposites. However, where they meet is really where successful women reside. They\\'re multifaceted beings who are able to balance the two contrasting concepts naturally.\\nGoing into 2025, expect this new corporate aesthetic to hit the streets more and more. We\\'ve already seen Saint Laurent\\'s versions on Hailey Bieber and Rosé, but there will, no doubt, be unique takes hitting our social media feeds everywhere very soon. To help you out, here\\'s a tutorial on how to tie a tie. You\\'ll need it.\\n\\nZARA\\nStriped Silk-Viscose Tie\\n$46\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nZARA\\n100% Wool Jacket\\n$139\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\nMiu Miu\\nRegard Sunglasses\\n$505\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\n(Image credit: John Nacion/Getty Images; Taylor Hill/WireImage; Gilbert Carrasquillo/GC Images/Getty Images; Courtesy of Prada; Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic/Getty Images; Gilbert Carrasquillo/GC Images/Getty Images; Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images)\\nI recently attended the Shark Beauty Women\\'s Champions Classic, a two-game NCAA basketball event at Barclays Center, and the turnout for the second game of the night between the University of Connecticut (UConn) Huskies and the University of Louisville Cardinals was unlike anything I\\'ve ever seen. The place was packed, especially with women and girls, many of whom wore one specific T-shirt (unless they were wearing merch for UConn star player and Nike athlete Paige Bueckers) by the brand Togethxr. The tee is simple with four words printed on the front in all caps: Everyone watches women\\'s sports.\\nThat T-shirt says it all. According to a report published this month by Morning Consult, an American intelligence company, the WNBA was 2024\\'s fastest-growing brand among all U.S. adults. It was the first time since the company was founded in 2014 that a sports league ranked first on this list. According to StubHub, ticket sales were up nearly 10 times in 2024 compared to 2023 before the season even began. \"This year\\'s NCAA Women\\'s Final Four and the WNBA Finals were the best-selling in StubHub history,\" the company published in a recent report. But it\\'s not just women\\'s basketball that\\'s on an upward trajectory.\\nFollowing the Paris Olympics, which saw 28 out of 32 sports be fully gender equal, female medalists like Suni Lee, Tara Davis-Woodhall, and Ilona Maher were ubiquitous, particularly at fashion events.

Here are the key trends that are expected to dominate the fashion landscape:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Boho Chic**: A polished comeback of bohemian styles, emphasizing romantic and feminine silhouettes. Expect to see suede jackets, wide-leg jeans, and flowing maxi dresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Aquatic Influences**: This trend includes mermaid-core aesthetics with glamour, sequins, and fishtail skirts, alongside sporty elements like fishnet jogger pants.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Soft Power Workwear**: A shift towards softer, more relaxed versions of traditional workwear. Suits are becoming oversized and styled with personal accessories.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Pale Pink**: Following the popularity of red in 2024, pale pink is set to take center stage in 2025, featured heavily by brands like Alaïa and Brandon Maxwell.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Plaid and Checks**: A resurgence of plaid, rendered in softer colors and shapes, is expected to be a staple for spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Ruffled and Bubble Shapes**: Ruffled pieces and bubble skirts are making a statement, adding a playful and dynamic element to outfits.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Excess and Opulence**: A move towards more extravagant aesthetics, with metallics, feathers, and bold jewelry becoming prominent.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Reality Dressing**: A focus on practicality and comfort, with relaxed silhouettes and softer fabrics becoming more popular.\n",
      "\n",
      "These trends reflect a blend of nostalgia, practicality, and a desire for self-expression, indicating a vibrant and diverse fashion landscape for 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer: The latest fashion trends for 2025 include Boho Chic styles, aquatic influences, soft power workwear, pale pink as a dominant color, plaid and checks, ruffled and bubble shapes, a focus on excess and opulence, and a shift towards reality dressing.\u001b[0m\n",

It’s not usually a gift — just something we totally forgot we ordered two days ago. Is it a cheese grater? Or that new towel? Or maybe the coveted mascara we saw on sale! If you know the feeling, you also know how easy it is to get sucked into Amazon’s seemingly endless virtual shelves looking for treasures.\\nBecause we love you, the Katie Couric Media staff scoured the mega retailer’s offerings to compile a list of must-have products — from bestsellers to hidden gems to undeniable deals. We included warm-weather fashion must-haves and luxury gadgets, alongside kitchen tools that truly deliver in the convenience department, and plenty of other low-risk, high-reward scores to add to your cart, whether you’re looking to splurge or save on an item for yourself or a gift. And since Amazon is ever-evolving, stay tuned as we update this list with our most recent purchases (and repurchases).\\nWith Amazon Prime Day officially here, the prices are dropping on our faves right now.\\nThe Best Things to Buy on Amazon Right Now\\nApple AirPods Pro\\n\\nAmazon\\n~$249~ (32% off)\\nThere’s no denying that Apple makes\\xa0really\\xa0great audio gear. Their AirPods Pro are regular bestsellers, and for good reason. Not only is the sound quality unbeatable, but features like noise cancellation result in a concert-like experience, and transparency mode lets you cancel out chaos without tuning out too much, making for safe and alert listening.\\n$169 at Amazon\\nLancôme Advanced Génifique Face Serum\\n\\nAmazon\\n~$170~ (30% off)\\nBattling fine lines in your skincare routine can be a frustrating journey, which is why when we find a product that works, we never turn back to that search. Lancôme is one of the trusted brands we reach for time and time again (and so does Katie!). This potent serum is made with 10 percent Bifidus prebiotic, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C, so that it can help improve your skin’s elasticity, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\\n$123 at Amazon\\nPerseveranX Plantar Fasciitis Relief Orthotics\\n\\nAmazon\\n~$40~ (40% off)\\nFoot health is something we need to think about more often. After all, we rely on our feet for a lot more than we really give them credit for. This NASA-grade memory foam pair of insoles from PerseveranX can help with plantar fasciitis, flat feet, over pronation, and high arches, making it a fit for any feet.\\n$24 at Amazon\\nLumineux Teeth Whitening Strips\\n\\nAmazon\\n~$50~ (40% off)\\nIf you’ve ever tried whitening your teeth, you’re probably familiar with the sensitivity that comes with the harsh chemicals most formulas contain. Luckily, our partners at Lumineux have developed a clinically proven formula that whitens your teeth without damaging your enamel or causing sensitivity in your teeth and gums. With purposeful ingredients like lemon peel oil, Dead Sea salt, and coconut oil, Lumineux’s whitening strips fight stains while keeping your mouth healthy and thriving.*\\n$30 at Amazon\\nWonhox Travel Backpack\\n\\nAmazon\\n~$37~ (16% off)\\nWith over 129 million views on TikTok, it’s an understatement to say that people are obsessed with this backpack. It’s the ideal travel bag, made of waterproof material with all of the following features: a ton of pockets to keep you organized, a USB charging port, a separate shoe compartment, and a back strap so it can be secured on top of a rolling suitcase.\\n$31 at Amazon\\nODODOS Unisex Mini Belt Bag 2.0\\n\\nAmazon\\nOdodos’ cult-favorite belt bag is a Wake-Up Call reader favorite, and the brand just upgraded the style for this sleek, 2.0 version with a two-way zipper and brand new colors. It rivals similar styles from designer athletic brands, but costs a fraction of the price. Also, we kind of love that it doesn’t have any labels.\\n$14 at Amazon\\nUnlock amazing deals and stay ahead of\\xa0trends.\\nBy joining you accept KCM Terms of Service & Privacy Policy\\nClose\\nThank you for subscribing! Look out for our emails in your inbox soon!\\nEmail \\nsource\\ncoi_opened\\ncoi_day_of_week\\nlast_referral_date\\ntotal_referrals\\nreferral_email\\nreferral_name\\nsource_detail\\n     Submit\\n\\nCandle Warmer\\n\\nAmazon\\n~$46~ (38% off)\\nThis candle-warming lamp allows you to enjoy your candle flame-free, which may sound pointless, but hear us out: It is so much safer. Who here hasn’t felt the shame of forgetting to blow out a candle before leaving the house or falling asleep? Warming the wax releases the scent just the way lighting a candle would, and the lamp setup produces the same warm glow a flame would.\\n$29 at Amazon\\nLaneige Lip Sleeping Mask\\n\\nAmazon\\n~$24~\\xa0(30% off)\\nAt this point, it seems like everyone and their mother has tried this viral lip mask — but it works, which is why we’ll keep using it until someone takes it away from us. It helps moisturize lips from the inside out, providing relief from flaky, cracked skin.\\n$17 at Amazon\\nSrhythm NiceComfort 95 Hybrid Noise Cancelling Headphones\\n\\nAmazon\\nSometimes, TikTok shoppers knows what they’re talking about. Our own staff agrees, and our producer Julia Lewis, swears by these headphones: “These headphones are so comfortable, have amazing noise cancelling capabilities (and trust me when I say this, I live in NYC on a very busy street and these have seriously changed my life), are super easy to sync up to your phone, laptop or tablet, and have a great battery life. Also — they fold up so they’re super easy to pack and throw in your carry on bag! Feel free to thank me later!”\\n$60 at Amazon\\nTrekproof Migraine Headache Relief Cap\\n\\nAmazon\\n~$18~ (20% off)\\nSuffering from migraines or dull headaches? Give yourself a much-needed break with this cap. You simply freeze the interior gel pack, then zip it into the pocket and wear it around your eyes. The cooling relief is a natural remedy for headaches, and some reviewers shared that they use them as smaller ice packs to help heal injuries.\\n$15 at Amazon\\nSpring Chef Magnetic Measuring Spoons Set\\n\\nAmazon\\nThere aren’t many items more essential to baking than measuring spoons, but it’s really difficult to find the perfect set. The round spoons don’t always fit into spice jars, the rectangular spoons don’t work well when the jars are almost empty, and maneuvering around the other spoons on the ring can be a real pain. Well, we just found the ideal set from Spring Chef. They’re double-sided to work well with jars of any shape and size, and they’re magnetic, so they stay together when you need them to and come apart when in use. As an added plus, the set comes with a leveler so you can stop using jar lids and getting cinnamon all over the counter.\\n$10 at Amazon\\nEssence Lash Princess Mascara 3-Pack\\n\\nAmazon\\n~$15~ (30% off)\\nGreat mascaras don’t have to be expensive — and Essence’s Lash Princess is proof. For only $5, this miracle-working mascara lifts, volumizes, lengthens, and defines in a couple of swipes. Commerce editor Katie Pittman has been using it for well over a year, and she says it doesn’t flake or run, even on her oily skin.\\n$10 at Amazon\\nSunzel Workout Leggings with High Waist Control\\n\\nAmazon\\nWhen you see something with nearly 29,000 positive reviews, it’s hard to pass up. Take these buttery-soft, but matte leggings: Not only do they cost less than $30, but reviewers say they’re extremely comfortable and squat-proof. And the main draw to almost any item of clothing? Pockets.\\n$28+ at Amazon\\nFable The Game Treat Dispenser\\n\\nAmazon\\nThis gift is for you\\xa0and\\xa0your furry friend. It’ll keep them entertained as they try to get treats out of the toppling toy, and you’ll feel better knowing they’re having fun while you’re out.\\n$55 at Amazon\\nVobaga Coffee Mug Warmer\\n\\nAmazon\\n~$43~ (54% off)\\nIf you can’t seem to drink your coffee fast enough to avoid that disgustingly cold last sip, look no further than this mug warmer. Place your fresh cup of coffee or tea on the coaster, choose your setting, and sip away at your leisure. Though it doesn’t offer the same level of personalization as the Ember smart mug ($110), this warmer works well at a much lower price point. A light on the warmer alerts you when the surface is still hot to help avoid accidental burns.\\n$20 at amazon\\nWide-Brimmed Sun Hat\\n\\nAmazon\\nWhether you have a fun beach- or poolside vacation planned or you’re just gardening at home, this packable sun hat should be in your cart. It comes in a bunch of colors and the wide brim will keep you shielded from the sun in style.\\n$26 at Amazon\\nRevlon One-Step Volumizer Hot Air Brush\\n\\nAmazon\\n~$70~ (56% off)\\nYou’ve heard of a certain $300-plus blow dryer brush, but for a more budget-friendly option that will still give your hair the lift and shine you’re looking for, we recommend the Revlon Volumizer Air Brush. You can use it to style and dry your hair with one hand, rather than wrangling a brush and blow dryer at the same time. There’s also a Plus (also $40) version with a ceramic barrel to protect your hair, a smaller width to get closer to your scalp, and a medium heat setting.\\n$31 at Amazon\\nFinishing Touch Flawless Hair Remover\\n\\nAmazon\\nLet’s be real here: Whatever your facial hair removal method is, you’ve probably just about reached the end of your rope with it. Tweezing is time-consuming and painful, professional waxing or threading is expensive and painful, and at-home waxing is messy and, again, painful. Plus, all those methods leave your face red for hours afterward, precluding last-minute upkeep. Enter Finishing Touch’s Flawless hair remover, a pocket-friendly little razor that gently and effectively removes facial hair in a matter of seconds. Whether you incorporate it into your daily routine or use it only in emergencies, the Flawless will definitely be a lifesaver.\\n$17+ at Amazon\\nHead Massager\\n\\nAmazon\\n~$15~ (46% off)\\nPlease bear with us as we sing the praises of this unusual but 100-percent-worth-it gadget. You. Will. Love. It. The flexible metal prongs truly relax you and relieve stress, and you can bend them to match the shape of your head. The well-made massager is easy to clean and comes with a lifetime warranty. That’s really all we can say…go try it out!\\n$8 at Amazon\\nWake Up Light Sunrise Alarm Clock\\n\\nAmazon\\n~$53~ (43% off)\\nThis handy gadget functions as a sleep aid, an alarm clock, and a nightlight all in one. The light brightens gradually over 10, 20, or 30 minutes, making it perfect for anyone who doesn’t get much natural light in the morning. The clock has seven soothing alarm sounds, including birds chirping, running water, and soft music, to further improve your wakeup experience. To top it off, the light can be turned to different colors and it has an FM radio built in. Ditch your phone alarm for this clock — you won’t regret it.\\n$30 at Amazon\\nDrop Stop Car Seat Gap Filler\\n\\nAmazon\\n~$25~ (20% off)\\nNext on the list of solutions you didn’t know existed are these car seat gap fillers. The neoprene inserts fill the space between the seat and center console in most cars to prevent your phone, keys, chapstick, or one of the many other items you’re juggling from falling into the abyss. The fillers slip over and snugly attach around the seat belt so they don’t slide around, and they move with the seat in most cars.\\n$20 at Amazon\\nWool Dryer Balls\\n\\nAmazon\\n~$20~ (40% off)\\nMade from 100 percent New Zealand wool, these reusable dryer balls are gentler than the spiky plastic alternatives and more environmentally friendly than disposable dryer sheets. The balls prevent wrinkles, decrease lint, and help keep clothes soft without introducing unwanted chemicals. They also decrease drying time and are machine washable. The list just goes on!\\n$12 at Amazon\\n*Denotes paid placement.\\n\\nWant more great content?\\nSign up here to jumpstart your mornings with Katie's dynamic daily newsletter, Wake-Up Call.\\nClose\\nSign up here:\\nThank you for subscribing!
