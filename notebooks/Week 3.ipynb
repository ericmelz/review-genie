With some careful planning and preparation, you can create a stylish backsplash that is long-lasting and easy to maintain. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to properly install wallpaper as a backsplash in your home.\\nChoose the Right Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nWhen selecting a wallpaper for a backsplash application, you’ll want to consider:\\n\\nMoisture resistance – Since the backsplash will be installed behind a sink or stove where it will be exposed to moisture, choose a vinyl or paper wallpaper specifically designed for high-humidity areas. Avoid regular paper wallpapers.\\nWashability – Pick a scrubbable and stain-resistant wallpaper, so it will be easy to keep clean.\\nSize of pattern – Smaller scale patterns will be easiest to work with. Large patterns can be tricky to line up.\\nSheen – Consider how the sheen (matte, satin, semi-gloss, etc.) will interact with your lighting. Glossier papers will be easier to wipe clean.\\nAdhesive – For backsplashes, always use a permanent, heavy-duty adhesive to prevent peeling or bubbling.\\nQuantity – Measure to determine how much wallpaper you will need to cover your backsplash area. Don’t forget to account for pattern matching and cutting allowance.\\n\\nPrepare the Surface\\nProper surface prep is crucial for successful wallpaper installation.\\n\\nMake sure the surface is clean, dry, smooth, and free of grease. Fill any cracks or holes with spackle.\\nSand glossy surfaces lightly to “rough up” and improve adhesion.\\nPrime walls before installing the wallpaper, especially if painting previously. Use an interior wallpaper primer or sealer.\\nFor tile backsplashes, scuff the surface with sandpaper so the adhesive adheres well. Clean thoroughly after sanding.\\n\\nPlan the Layout\\n\\nDecide on your starting point based on the pattern size and shape. It often works best to start in a less visible corner.\\nDetermine if you will need to cut any edges to fit your backsplash area cleanly. Plan ahead for straight cuts.\\nMake sure to match patterns from strip to strip. Plan the layout so seams fall between tiles or at grout lines.\\n\\nPrepare the Wallpaper\\n\\nUnroll the wallpaper and allow it to relax according to manufacturer directions, usually 10-20 minutes.\\nUsing a sharp razor blade, straightedge or wallpaper trimmer, neatly trim off the factory edges. Cut wallpaper strips to your desired length.\\nDraw plumb lines on the surface as guides for your first strip. Use a level and pencil.\\n\\nApply Adhesive\\n\\nApply an even coat of heavy-duty wallpaper adhesive directly onto the backsplash surface using a paint roller or wide brush. Don’t get adhesive on the face of the wallpaper.\\nFold book ends of the strips to keep edges clean and prevent sticking during application.\\nAllow adhesive to become tacky according to manufacturer’s directions before applying wallpaper. This is known as “open time”.\\n\\nInstall the Wallpaper\\n\\nHang your first strip, sliding it into position using a wallpaper smoother or plastic scraper. Move from the middle outwards to squeeze out air pockets. Use a level to keep the strip straight.\\nUse a razor blade to trim excess paper at ceilings, countertops or edges. Make straight cuts.\\nApply the next strip directly beside the first, being careful to match the pattern precisely at the seam. Overlap edges slightly.\\nUse a seam roller to set the seam firmly. Roll the entire strip to smooth and adhere, eliminating bubbles or wrinkles.\\nContinue applying additional strips in this same manner until the backsplash is fully covered.\\nAt corners or outlets, carefully cut the wallpaper to fit using an X-acto knife and metal ruler. Take your time here for best results.\\nWhen finished, wipe the entire surface with a clean, damp sponge to remove any adhesive residue.\\n\\nApply Wallpaper Finishing\\n\\nOnce the wallpaper is fully adhered, apply an acrylic wallpaper primer/sealer over the entire backsplash surface. This provides added protection from moisture damage.\\nUse a smoothing brush or mini roller, and apply according to the manufacturer’s directions.\\nFinally, consider applying a clear acrylic wallpaper top-coat to add a washable, water-resistant layer of protection. This is highly recommended for backsplashes.\\n\\nWith careful prep and installation, your new wallpaper backsplash will provide a beautiful focal point in your kitchen or bathroom for years to come! Be sure to properly clean and maintain it by wiping gently with a damp sponge or soft cloth. Avoid abrasive cleaners or scrubbing aggressively. Enjoy your stylish new backsplash!\\nFrequently Asked Questions About Installing a Wallpaper Backsplash\\nWhat type of wall surface works best for a wallpaper backsplash?\\nThe best surfaces for adhering wallpaper are smooth drywall, plaster, concrete, wood paneling, or primed surfaces. Avoid heavily textured or porous surfaces.\\nShould I apply primer before installing wallpaper on a backsplash?\\nPriming provides a uniform, sealed surface that will improve adhesion. Use a high-quality acrylic primer made specifically for wallpaper.\\nWhat’s the best way to measure for the amount of wallpaper I’ll need?\\nCarefully measure the backsplash area’s dimensions. Add at least 6 inches on all sides to allow for trimming. Factor in pattern matching too.\\nHow do I cut wallpaper cleanly on an uneven or textured surface?\\nUse a specialty wallpaper knife with a hooked blade. Keep the knife flat against the surface to cut precisely.\\nShould seams be vertical or horizontal on a backsplash?\\nHorizontal seams are easier to hide by lining them up with tile grout lines. Vertical seams work too. Avoid outside corners.\\nWhat if my backsplash area has an outlet that needs covering?\\nCarefully measure and cut the wallpaper with an X-acto knife around the outlet. Take your time for clean results.\\nHow soon can I use my backsplash after installing wallpaper?\\nAllow all adhesive to dry completely, usually 24-48 hours. Avoid moisture until fully cured. Gently wipe clean with a damp sponge.\\nConclusion\\nInstalling wallpaper can completely transform the look of a backsplash while adding color, texture and interest to your space. With some careful surface preparation and layout planning, the project can easily be DIYed in a weekend. Use a heavy-duty adhesive and take precautions to protect the finished wallpaper from moisture damage. The end result will a stylish, unique focal point in your kitchen or bath. With a wallpaper backsplash, you can inexpensively change up the look whenever desired.

But by far, one of the most transformative wallpaper projects I’ve tackled was the backsplash in our ugly California kitchen. Wallpaper is an awesome backsplash alternative to traditional tile (especially for us renters!), but it’s also a fairly tricky installation process thanks to outlets, low-hanging cabinets, appliances, and precise patterns. Today, I’m breaking down exactly how to wallpaper a kitchen backsplash so you feel inspired (and prepared!) to tackle this challenging (but rewarding!) DIY project yourself!\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nToggle\\n\\nBefore & After\\nUsing Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nSupplies Needed\\nStep 1: Clear & Clean the Backsplash\\nStep 2: Measure Your Backsplash\\nStep 3: Plan Your Wallpaper Layout\\nStep 4: Cut the Wallpaper\\nStep 5: Apply the Wallpaper\\nDeciding Where to Stop the Wallpapered Backsplash\\nOther Renter-Friendly Kitchen Updates\\n\\nBefore & After\\nHere is our kitchen before I added a fun backsplash using peel-and-stick wallpaper. As you can see, I started with a ~ugly~ monochromatic and dark blank slate.\\n\\nAnd here is how the kitchen looked after the application of a bright white hexagon peel-and-stick wallpaper!\\n\\nThe bright white paper infused some lightness and brightness into the otherwise dreary kitchen. The hexagon design nods to a tile pattern, and the gold lines play off the cabinets just enough to make it all work nicely together.\\n\\nAlthough adding a crisp white wallpaper to this dreary space was quite the gamble, it ended up being money and time so well spent (as wallpaper almost always is!)\\n\\n\\nWhile this transformation was well worth the blood, sweat, and tears, it is definitely one of the tricker wallpapering projects I’ve done…so let me walk you through everything you need to know before you tackle something like this in your own space!\\nUsing Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nIn a “normal” kitchen, a backsplash is usually created with tile. But there might be lots of reasons you don’t want a tiled backsplash including your budget, your DIY confidence, and (as is our case) the permanence. As renters, we can’t do anything permanent to our homes, so wallpaper is an excellent alternative for adding color, pattern, and style to an otherwise bland kitchen.\\nWhy Not Use Peel-and-Stick Tile?\\nI get asked all the time why I don’t use peel-and-stick tile in our rental kitchens. And my answer is: because it’s not removable!\\nJust because something is peel-and-stick doesn’t mean it comes off easily and mess-free. In my experience, peel-and-stick tile is not a removable product and will destroy the drywall as you peel it off. If you want to add a backsplash that is removable, wallpaper (or vinyl decals like I show here) is going to be your best bet.\\nIf you REALLY want to use peel and stick tile, I came up with a clever hack to keep it renter-friendly and totally removable! See it here:\\xa0How to Install a Peel & Stick Tile Backsplash In a Rental (Without Damage!)\\n\\nWhat Type of Wallpaper Is Best for a Backsplash?\\nYou can technically wallpaper a backsplash with any wallpaper (e.g., peel-and-stick, pre-pasted, non-pasted etc). However, since this wallpaper will be in an area that gets wet, moist, and dirty, I do recommend picking a vinyl wallpaper (rather than fabric or textured) that is wipeable (most will indicate so on the packaging).\\nI personally recommending using peel-and-stick wallpaper or heavy-duty contact paper for backsplashes because they are both durable (easy to wipe clean) and removable (it just peels right off!)\\nDoes the Wallpaper Need to Be “Waterproof”?\\nIn my experience, no…at least not for a kitchen. While you may experience some splashing of water or food particles on your wallpapered backsplash, the area will rarely (if ever) get heavily saturated. As such, you will want a wallpaper you can easily wipe clean, but it does not need to be labeled “waterproof” to work well on a backsplash.\\nPicking a Wallpaper Pattern for a Backsplash\\nYou can really pick any wallpaper pattern to put on your backsplash. But if you’re hoping to mimic the look of real tile, keep an eye out for patterns that look like tile! Here are some great examples:\\n\\n1 – Black & White Herringbone | 2 – Grey & Gold Hexagon Paper | 3 – Cream & Neutral Hexagon Paper | 4 – Black Hexagon Wallpaper | 5 – White & Silver Cube Wallpaper | 6 – Blue Medallion Wallpaper | 7 – Black & White Circle Wallpaper | 8 – Grey & White Hexagon Wallpaper | 9 – Faux Brick Wallpaper | 10 – White Subway Tile Wallpaper | 11 – Black Marble Tile Wallpaper | 12 – Long Hexagon Tile Wallpaper | 13 – Marble Herringbone Wallpaper | 14 – Blue Mosaic Tile Wallpaper | 15 – Black & Gold Trellis Wallpaper | 16 – Grey & White Medallion Wallpaper\\nFrom the moment I first saw this photo on the Walls Need Love’s Instagram account, I knew the white and gold hex pattern was perfect for a wallpapered “tile” backsplash for our kitchen!\\nDetermining How Much Wallpaper You Need\\nBefore purchasing your wallpaper, it’s a good idea to accurately measure the space you are wallpapering and devise a plan for how you will use the paper.\\nWhen determining how much paper you need, be sure to take into account:\\n\\nThe surface area you want to cover\\nThe roll dimensions\\nPattern size and scale\\nPattern repeat information (usually detailed on the wallpaper’s web description or packaging)\\nWhich orientation you will hang the paper (as that can affect how much or little you need to cover certain size areas)\\n\\nIf the paper you want to use can be easily returned, considering buying extra, because not being able to finish when you run out of paper can be very…very…frustrating.\\n\\nSupplies Needed\\nEvery project will vary slightly; but in general, here are the supplies you will need to wallpaper a backsplash:\\n\\nWallpaper\\nCutting Tools\\nRotary cutter, ruler and self-healing cutting mat (although a ruler and scissors will do, these tools make it easy to get really precise cuts)\\nSharp scissors\\nSharp craft knife\\n\\n\\nPaddle Scraper – Some wallpapers come with a smoothing tool, but I prefer the wide size and shape of this one for big wallpaper projects.\\nBasic Tools\\nMeasuring tape\\nScrewdrivers for removing outlet covers\\nCalculator\\nNotebook and pencil\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 1: Clear & Clean the Backsplash\\nStart by removing any outlet covers, artwork, or other items covering your backsplash. Wipe down the blank walls of any dust, dirt, debris, grease, oil, or food particles. Let the wall(s) fully dry before applying wallpaper.\\n\\nStep 2: Measure Your Backsplash\\nWallpaper can be expensive, so I highly recommend spending a considerable amount of time planning out exactly how you will apply the paper to your backsplash (and other areas) before you even start cutting and peeling.\\nI mentioned before that wallpapering the backsplash was my trickiest papering job ever, and the picture above shows exactly why. Backsplashes tend to have lots of things that need to be papered around. Outlets are certainly one, but your backsplash might have vents, hoods, shelves, or other items that can’t be removed and need to be considered.\\nTIP! Whenever possible, remove items off the walls/cabinets instead of trying to work around them. Wallpaper is tricky enough to lay flat without anything in the way. I did everything I could to remove the under-cabinet lighting (above) but was unable to do so, which left me having to make tricky cuts around the fixtures.\\nIn order to deal with anything you need to paper around, make a detailed plan of your entire backsplash. As you can see below, I not only detailed out the length and height of each area (to the left of the stove, to the right of the stove, to the right of the window), but I also marked the exact placement of each light and outlet.\\nOn another page (not shown), I dove into even further detail, notating where precisely each light feature was so I could translate those measurements to the wallpaper during the cutting phase (more on that below).\\n\\nStep 3: Plan Your Wallpaper Layout\\nWith the dimensions fully calculated, you can then determine how best to cut your wallpaper.\\nTypically, wallpaper is hung from top to bottom and you work laterally across a space. These days, most paper is printed to be hung vertically, which will make cutting and hanging\\xa0much\\xa0easier.\\nI don’t ever do anything the easy way though. I wanted to use as little wallpaper as possible (because it’s expensive), so I chose to apply the paper horizontally (from left-to-right, rather than top-to-bottom). While this choice certainly added to the complexity of the installation, it did allow me to maximize every inch of paper with very little waste.\\nIn the notebook above (right-hand page), you’ll see I cut each wallpaper strip in half (possible because of the height of my backsplash and the horizontal installation). Instead of a 10′ length of 20″ wide paper (with lots of potential excess thanks to pattern matching), I instead had 20′ of 13″ tall strips that fit the horizontal area above the counter.\\nThis approach may not work for you based on your pattern and orientation preferences, but my point is this: think very carefully about how you can apply the pattern and how you can cut the paper to get the most space covered with as little paper as possible!\\nStep 4: Cut the Wallpaper\\nFiguring out the plan for the wallpaper may very well be your most tedious and time-consuming step. However, once you have all the measurements figured out, you just need to translate them to the wallpaper and get cutting.\\nCut Large Sections First\\nStart by cutting the large rolls down the general sizes determined in your planning. I found it easiest to do large cuts (both length-wise and width-wise) using a rotary cutter and large ruler. Before cutting a particular section, always be sure the patterns line up with the adjoining panels.\\n\\nTIP! I was trying to use up every inch of wallpaper, so I cut my panels down into the exact same measurements as my backsplash. However, if you are able to, try leaving an excess 1-3″ of paper along the top and bottom of each panel so it will perfectly reach the edges of your counters and cabinets no matter how straight (or not) you hang the paper. Then trim away the edges after the paper is on the wall.\\nPre-Cut Details\\nNOTE: If your backsplash area doesn’t have any large or unique features to work around, you can likely skip this step and set right to hanging your larger cuts of paper directly to the wall.\\nWhen papering large expanses of wall, I usually deal with outlets and other features as I’m laying the paper down. However, the backsplash area is such a tight space with so many extra features to work around, that it can be very difficult to get the paper to lie flat without pre-cutting out bulky features.\\nAfter some trial-and-error, I determined it was much easier to cut each feature (the light fixtures) out of the wallpaper before applying it to the wall. To do this, translate the size and placement of any “extra” features (precise size and location measurements are KEY!) to the larger wallpaper strips. In the photo below, you can see the faint lines of the light fixture (along the top) and the outlet (vertical line in the top/middle).\\n\\nOnce you have each feature measured and “drawn,” cut them out using a ruler and very sharp craft knife. This part can feel tedious and a bit scary (slicing big holes in the middle of your wallpaper can be a big risk!) so don’t hesitate to re-measure and double-check as much as necessary!\\n\\nStep 5: Apply the Wallpaper\\nOnce you have all the necessary features cut out of the wallpaper strip, it’s time to apply it! As I mentioned above, I chose to hang my temporary wallpaper horizontally to conserve paper and eliminate excessive match lines on such a small area.\\nNo matter how you are applying your paper (top-to-bottom or side-to-side), peel off just a few inches of the paper backing from the top/side of the wallpaper. Stick that leading edge to the wall, ensuring it is as straight as possible. Then as you work across/down the wall, slowly peel away the paper backing and smooth the paper down with a large paddle scraper.\\n\\nAs you get to edges, outlets, and corners, use a sharp craft knife to make notches as necessary (to relieve paper tension) or trim away extra paper. Once you get the paper in place, use the scraper to really adhere the paper to the wall and work out any wrinkles or bubbles.\\n\\nContinuing hanging your panels, matching up the patterns and working around features, until your entire backsplash area is covered in removable wallpaper!\\nWorking Around Outlets\\nBefore hanging the wallpaper on the wall, I recommend creating a single vertical slit for each outlet (to relieve the paper tension and allow the paper to lay flat on the surrounding wall). Once the paper is fully adhered to the wall, re-visit the outlets to trim away extra paper and ensure it’s laying smooth and flat in every direction. Replace outlet covers only once you’re satisfied with the placement and smoothness of the wallpaper.\\n\\nMore Application Tips & Tricks\\nMy pictures and descriptions make it sound like you just lay the paper down, replace your outlet covers, and walk away. In truth, it will require a lot of placing, peeling off and re-placing; tugging and pulling; sweating; and maybe even crying. Working with peel-and-stick paper CAN be very exasperating, so here are some things to keep in mind:\\n\\nDon’t hesitate to pull it off and re-lay it down. Whether it’s your initial 2″ or the full sheet, if it’s angled funny or has lots of wrinkles you can’t easily get out with a scraper, simply peel the sheet off and re-stick it. I promise, it will stick again.\\nDon’t force it. If your initial 2″ of paper aren’t quite level, the paper will only continue to “veer off course” as you move down/across the wall. It’s better to peel it off and re-align the panel instead of trying to re-route the paper further down the wall.\\nCorners. I chose to cut long strips of paper that would stretch into and past the corners so that the pattern would continue nicely. However, getting paper to “turn the corner” straight can be very difficult. In hindsight, I would have sliced the paper at each corner and started a fresh application at each turn.\\nThe paper is REALLY durable. Don’t hesitate to bend, wrinkle, or curl up the paper as you’re working with it. It’s veeeery durable and once you have it smoothed onto your wall, those bends and wrinkles won’t even be noticeable.\\nTake a step back. Despite my efforts for the smoothest application possible, I was still left with some pretty considerable wrinkles in the paper (those darn corners!). But that’s actually one of the best things about wallpaper. It’s so “big picture,” and those small imperfections aren’t really noticeable in day-to-day life. So do the best you can, step away, and just enjoy the improved view!\\n\\nDeciding Where to Stop the Wallpapered Backsplash\\nOne of the trickiest things about backsplashes (tiled, painted, papered, anything!) is deciding where to stop. In some kitchens, there will be doors, trim, appliances, molding, or ends of counter top that make it very clear where the wallpaper installation should end. Other times, it’s not as evident.\\nMy original plan was to only tile the backsplash, and I used the width of our countertop and the height of the cabinets as my guide (as seen below).\\n\\nBut even as I stepped back, put my supplies away, and called the job done, the “tiling” really bothered me. The white paper felt random in the context of the rest of the kitchen; and instead of my eye drifting to the pretty paper, it kept drifting to the ceiling where there was none. Below is a quick snapshot I took as I debated (for weeks!) what to do about it.\\n\\nI finally decided that I needed to extend the wallpaper up the wall to the ceiling in order to make it work. After a quick calculation, I determined I had enough paper leftover to cover the remaining wall (I originally bought enough to “tile” the fireplace in the adjoining family room too).\\n\\nThe wonderful thing about installing wallpaper above cabinets is that there is usually nothing to work around…no outlets, no lights! As such, I just cut the paper into strips and put it right up, matching the pattern as I went around the kitchen.\\n\\nWe lived with just the backsplash area done for about 2 months before I finally did the rest of the wall, and to say the change was dramatic is an understatement. The wallpapered backsplash went from feeling random and disjointed to providing a fun and fresh detail that really woke up the entire kitchen.\\nIf your cabinets do not reach the ceiling or a soffit, I highly recommend wallpapering the area above the cabinets for the most visual impact.\\n\\n\\nIn the three years we lived in this house, I was never\\xa0really able to get used to the brown cabinets and brown counters and brown floors. But the small temporary changes I was able to make (like the wallpapered backsplash and this simple window valance) truly helped me like the space a lot more than the dull cave we started with. Although this wallpaper backsplash wasn’t the easiest DIY I’ve taken on, it was certainly one of the most rewarding!\\n\\nOther Renter-Friendly Kitchen Updates\\n\\nHow to Shiplap a Kitchen Island with Command Strips\\nA DIY Butcher Block Island Countertop (Anyone Can Do!)\\nAn Easy Way to Add Pattern to Your Pantry with Wrapping Paper\\n\\nWhether you rent or own, I suspect most of us have aspects of our homes we just don’t love.

It makes such a difference. Here’s another suggestion for you. Chalkboard vinyl on the panels of your cabinet doors. My son-in-law suggested that I paint my doors with the chalkboard paint, but I couldn’t bring myself to do something so permanent. I found the vinyl online though, on some sort of deal, and I LOVE IT. It is fun to label my cabinets, and it would cut way back on the brown in your kitchen. (I think it would coordinate with the black on your fridge and appliances, too.) Anyway, just a suggestion.

Most peel-and-stick papers are like a thick contact paper, so they can easily be wiped clean. I would just be sure not to pick a fabric-like wallpaper or one with texture, although even some of those would likely be fine. Wallpaper is much more durable than people think!\\nHope that helps!\\nMegan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVanessa — April 8, 2020 @ 11:41 am Reply\\nI love this! Such a great idea. Love your blog!

And we have lived in North Carolina, Kansas, California and Virginia. That said, I would ALWAYS do a test on any wall and leave it up for a while before you do a full installation.\\nThird, most peel-and-stick wallpapers are wipeable/washable. So if the wallpaper DOES stay up, you’d be able to clean it without any issue. The white wallpaper in this post was wiped down with a wet rag constantly.\\nFinally, if you determine you do need something over the wallpaper, some sort of plexiglass/acrylic sheet could work (although it would be pricey) or you could try clear contact paper.\\xa0\\nHope those thoughts help a bit!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDS53 — October 12, 2020 @ 9:46 pm Reply\\nYou are so very inspiring!\\n\\n\\nthehomesihavemade — October 16, 2020 @ 8:51 am Reply\\nThanks so much…glad you stopped by!\\nMegan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShonda — April 14, 2022 @ 10:58 am Reply\\nAny thoughts on how you would manage an outside corner with wallpaper?\\n\\n\\nMegan — April 14, 2022 @ 12:03 pm Reply\\nHi Shonda!\\nI’m not sure what you mean by outside corner…do you mean one that protrudes outward rather than in?\\nI actually think paper bends easier around a protruding\\xa0corner, but it will still be tricky to keep it perfectly level. I’d give it a try going around the corner first. If you can’t get the follow-on paper to line up level, then you could technically cut it at the corner and start over, but you run the risk of the seam being really visible.\\xa0\\nIf you cut your paper 1-2″ taller than you need, you’d be able to turn the corner and not have any gap between the paper and the upper cabinets, even if it does go a little off as you make the bend.\\nDoes that help?\\nThanks!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContent Sidebar\\n\\nHi, I'm Megan!\\nI am a military spouse, mom to 3 young boys, and a constant creator.

But by far, one of the most transformative wallpaper projects I’ve tackled was the backsplash in our ugly California kitchen. Wallpaper is an awesome backsplash alternative to traditional tile (especially for us renters!), but it’s also a fairly tricky installation process thanks to outlets, low-hanging cabinets, appliances, and precise patterns. Today, I’m breaking down exactly how to wallpaper a kitchen backsplash so you feel inspired (and prepared!) to tackle this challenging (but rewarding!) DIY project yourself!\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nToggle\\n\\nBefore & After\\nUsing Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nSupplies Needed\\nStep 1: Clear & Clean the Backsplash\\nStep 2: Measure Your Backsplash\\nStep 3: Plan Your Wallpaper Layout\\nStep 4: Cut the Wallpaper\\nStep 5: Apply the Wallpaper\\nDeciding Where to Stop the Wallpapered Backsplash\\nOther Renter-Friendly Kitchen Updates\\n\\nBefore & After\\nHere is our kitchen before I added a fun backsplash using peel-and-stick wallpaper. As you can see, I started with a ~ugly~ monochromatic and dark blank slate.\\n\\nAnd here is how the kitchen looked after the application of a bright white hexagon peel-and-stick wallpaper!\\n\\nThe bright white paper infused some lightness and brightness into the otherwise dreary kitchen. The hexagon design nods to a tile pattern, and the gold lines play off the cabinets just enough to make it all work nicely together.\\n\\nAlthough adding a crisp white wallpaper to this dreary space was quite the gamble, it ended up being money and time so well spent (as wallpaper almost always is!)\\n\\n\\nWhile this transformation was well worth the blood, sweat, and tears, it is definitely one of the tricker wallpapering projects I’ve done…so let me walk you through everything you need to know before you tackle something like this in your own space!\\nUsing Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nIn a “normal” kitchen, a backsplash is usually created with tile. But there might be lots of reasons you don’t want a tiled backsplash including your budget, your DIY confidence, and (as is our case) the permanence. As renters, we can’t do anything permanent to our homes, so wallpaper is an excellent alternative for adding color, pattern, and style to an otherwise bland kitchen.\\nWhy Not Use Peel-and-Stick Tile?\\nI get asked all the time why I don’t use peel-and-stick tile in our rental kitchens. And my answer is: because it’s not removable!\\nJust because something is peel-and-stick doesn’t mean it comes off easily and mess-free. In my experience, peel-and-stick tile is not a removable product and will destroy the drywall as you peel it off. If you want to add a backsplash that is removable, wallpaper (or vinyl decals like I show here) is going to be your best bet.\\nIf you REALLY want to use peel and stick tile, I came up with a clever hack to keep it renter-friendly and totally removable! See it here:\\xa0How to Install a Peel & Stick Tile Backsplash In a Rental (Without Damage!)\\n\\nWhat Type of Wallpaper Is Best for a Backsplash?\\nYou can technically wallpaper a backsplash with any wallpaper (e.g., peel-and-stick, pre-pasted, non-pasted etc). However, since this wallpaper will be in an area that gets wet, moist, and dirty, I do recommend picking a vinyl wallpaper (rather than fabric or textured) that is wipeable (most will indicate so on the packaging).\\nI personally recommending using peel-and-stick wallpaper or heavy-duty contact paper for backsplashes because they are both durable (easy to wipe clean) and removable (it just peels right off!)\\nDoes the Wallpaper Need to Be “Waterproof”?\\nIn my experience, no…at least not for a kitchen. While you may experience some splashing of water or food particles on your wallpapered backsplash, the area will rarely (if ever) get heavily saturated. As such, you will want a wallpaper you can easily wipe clean, but it does not need to be labeled “waterproof” to work well on a backsplash.\\nPicking a Wallpaper Pattern for a Backsplash\\nYou can really pick any wallpaper pattern to put on your backsplash. But if you’re hoping to mimic the look of real tile, keep an eye out for patterns that look like tile! Here are some great examples:\\n\\n1 – Black & White Herringbone | 2 – Grey & Gold Hexagon Paper | 3 – Cream & Neutral Hexagon Paper | 4 – Black Hexagon Wallpaper | 5 – White & Silver Cube Wallpaper | 6 – Blue Medallion Wallpaper | 7 – Black & White Circle Wallpaper | 8 – Grey & White Hexagon Wallpaper | 9 – Faux Brick Wallpaper | 10 – White Subway Tile Wallpaper | 11 – Black Marble Tile Wallpaper | 12 – Long Hexagon Tile Wallpaper | 13 – Marble Herringbone Wallpaper | 14 – Blue Mosaic Tile Wallpaper | 15 – Black & Gold Trellis Wallpaper | 16 – Grey & White Medallion Wallpaper\\nFrom the moment I first saw this photo on the Walls Need Love’s Instagram account, I knew the white and gold hex pattern was perfect for a wallpapered “tile” backsplash for our kitchen!\\nDetermining How Much Wallpaper You Need\\nBefore purchasing your wallpaper, it’s a good idea to accurately measure the space you are wallpapering and devise a plan for how you will use the paper.\\nWhen determining how much paper you need, be sure to take into account:\\n\\nThe surface area you want to cover\\nThe roll dimensions\\nPattern size and scale\\nPattern repeat information (usually detailed on the wallpaper’s web description or packaging)\\nWhich orientation you will hang the paper (as that can affect how much or little you need to cover certain size areas)\\n\\nIf the paper you want to use can be easily returned, considering buying extra, because not being able to finish when you run out of paper can be very…very…frustrating.\\n\\nSupplies Needed\\nEvery project will vary slightly; but in general, here are the supplies you will need to wallpaper a backsplash:\\n\\nWallpaper\\nCutting Tools\\nRotary cutter, ruler and self-healing cutting mat (although a ruler and scissors will do, these tools make it easy to get really precise cuts)\\nSharp scissors\\nSharp craft knife\\n\\n\\nPaddle Scraper – Some wallpapers come with a smoothing tool, but I prefer the wide size and shape of this one for big wallpaper projects.\\nBasic Tools\\nMeasuring tape\\nScrewdrivers for removing outlet covers\\nCalculator\\nNotebook and pencil\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 1: Clear & Clean the Backsplash\\nStart by removing any outlet covers, artwork, or other items covering your backsplash. Wipe down the blank walls of any dust, dirt, debris, grease, oil, or food particles. Let the wall(s) fully dry before applying wallpaper.\\n\\nStep 2: Measure Your Backsplash\\nWallpaper can be expensive, so I highly recommend spending a considerable amount of time planning out exactly how you will apply the paper to your backsplash (and other areas) before you even start cutting and peeling.\\nI mentioned before that wallpapering the backsplash was my trickiest papering job ever, and the picture above shows exactly why. Backsplashes tend to have lots of things that need to be papered around. Outlets are certainly one, but your backsplash might have vents, hoods, shelves, or other items that can’t be removed and need to be considered.\\nTIP! Whenever possible, remove items off the walls/cabinets instead of trying to work around them. Wallpaper is tricky enough to lay flat without anything in the way. I did everything I could to remove the under-cabinet lighting (above) but was unable to do so, which left me having to make tricky cuts around the fixtures.\\nIn order to deal with anything you need to paper around, make a detailed plan of your entire backsplash. As you can see below, I not only detailed out the length and height of each area (to the left of the stove, to the right of the stove, to the right of the window), but I also marked the exact placement of each light and outlet.\\nOn another page (not shown), I dove into even further detail, notating where precisely each light feature was so I could translate those measurements to the wallpaper during the cutting phase (more on that below).\\n\\nStep 3: Plan Your Wallpaper Layout\\nWith the dimensions fully calculated, you can then determine how best to cut your wallpaper.\\nTypically, wallpaper is hung from top to bottom and you work laterally across a space. These days, most paper is printed to be hung vertically, which will make cutting and hanging\\xa0much\\xa0easier.\\nI don’t ever do anything the easy way though. I wanted to use as little wallpaper as possible (because it’s expensive), so I chose to apply the paper horizontally (from left-to-right, rather than top-to-bottom). While this choice certainly added to the complexity of the installation, it did allow me to maximize every inch of paper with very little waste.\\nIn the notebook above (right-hand page), you’ll see I cut each wallpaper strip in half (possible because of the height of my backsplash and the horizontal installation). Instead of a 10′ length of 20″ wide paper (with lots of potential excess thanks to pattern matching), I instead had 20′ of 13″ tall strips that fit the horizontal area above the counter.\\nThis approach may not work for you based on your pattern and orientation preferences, but my point is this: think very carefully about how you can apply the pattern and how you can cut the paper to get the most space covered with as little paper as possible!\\nStep 4: Cut the Wallpaper\\nFiguring out the plan for the wallpaper may very well be your most tedious and time-consuming step. However, once you have all the measurements figured out, you just need to translate them to the wallpaper and get cutting.\\nCut Large Sections First\\nStart by cutting the large rolls down the general sizes determined in your planning. I found it easiest to do large cuts (both length-wise and width-wise) using a rotary cutter and large ruler. Before cutting a particular section, always be sure the patterns line up with the adjoining panels.\\n\\nTIP! I was trying to use up every inch of wallpaper, so I cut my panels down into the exact same measurements as my backsplash. However, if you are able to, try leaving an excess 1-3″ of paper along the top and bottom of each panel so it will perfectly reach the edges of your counters and cabinets no matter how straight (or not) you hang the paper. Then trim away the edges after the paper is on the wall.\\nPre-Cut Details\\nNOTE: If your backsplash area doesn’t have any large or unique features to work around, you can likely skip this step and set right to hanging your larger cuts of paper directly to the wall.\\nWhen papering large expanses of wall, I usually deal with outlets and other features as I’m laying the paper down. However, the backsplash area is such a tight space with so many extra features to work around, that it can be very difficult to get the paper to lie flat without pre-cutting out bulky features.\\nAfter some trial-and-error, I determined it was much easier to cut each feature (the light fixtures) out of the wallpaper before applying it to the wall. To do this, translate the size and placement of any “extra” features (precise size and location measurements are KEY!) to the larger wallpaper strips. In the photo below, you can see the faint lines of the light fixture (along the top) and the outlet (vertical line in the top/middle).\\n\\nOnce you have each feature measured and “drawn,” cut them out using a ruler and very sharp craft knife. This part can feel tedious and a bit scary (slicing big holes in the middle of your wallpaper can be a big risk!) so don’t hesitate to re-measure and double-check as much as necessary!\\n\\nStep 5: Apply the Wallpaper\\nOnce you have all the necessary features cut out of the wallpaper strip, it’s time to apply it! As I mentioned above, I chose to hang my temporary wallpaper horizontally to conserve paper and eliminate excessive match lines on such a small area.\\nNo matter how you are applying your paper (top-to-bottom or side-to-side), peel off just a few inches of the paper backing from the top/side of the wallpaper. Stick that leading edge to the wall, ensuring it is as straight as possible. Then as you work across/down the wall, slowly peel away the paper backing and smooth the paper down with a large paddle scraper.\\n\\nAs you get to edges, outlets, and corners, use a sharp craft knife to make notches as necessary (to relieve paper tension) or trim away extra paper. Once you get the paper in place, use the scraper to really adhere the paper to the wall and work out any wrinkles or bubbles.\\n\\nContinuing hanging your panels, matching up the patterns and working around features, until your entire backsplash area is covered in removable wallpaper!\\nWorking Around Outlets\\nBefore hanging the wallpaper on the wall, I recommend creating a single vertical slit for each outlet (to relieve the paper tension and allow the paper to lay flat on the surrounding wall). Once the paper is fully adhered to the wall, re-visit the outlets to trim away extra paper and ensure it’s laying smooth and flat in every direction. Replace outlet covers only once you’re satisfied with the placement and smoothness of the wallpaper.\\n\\nMore Application Tips & Tricks\\nMy pictures and descriptions make it sound like you just lay the paper down, replace your outlet covers, and walk away. In truth, it will require a lot of placing, peeling off and re-placing; tugging and pulling; sweating; and maybe even crying. Working with peel-and-stick paper CAN be very exasperating, so here are some things to keep in mind:\\n\\nDon’t hesitate to pull it off and re-lay it down. Whether it’s your initial 2″ or the full sheet, if it’s angled funny or has lots of wrinkles you can’t easily get out with a scraper, simply peel the sheet off and re-stick it. I promise, it will stick again.\\nDon’t force it. If your initial 2″ of paper aren’t quite level, the paper will only continue to “veer off course” as you move down/across the wall. It’s better to peel it off and re-align the panel instead of trying to re-route the paper further down the wall.\\nCorners. I chose to cut long strips of paper that would stretch into and past the corners so that the pattern would continue nicely. However, getting paper to “turn the corner” straight can be very difficult. In hindsight, I would have sliced the paper at each corner and started a fresh application at each turn.\\nThe paper is REALLY durable. Don’t hesitate to bend, wrinkle, or curl up the paper as you’re working with it. It’s veeeery durable and once you have it smoothed onto your wall, those bends and wrinkles won’t even be noticeable.\\nTake a step back. Despite my efforts for the smoothest application possible, I was still left with some pretty considerable wrinkles in the paper (those darn corners!). But that’s actually one of the best things about wallpaper. It’s so “big picture,” and those small imperfections aren’t really noticeable in day-to-day life. So do the best you can, step away, and just enjoy the improved view!\\n\\nDeciding Where to Stop the Wallpapered Backsplash\\nOne of the trickiest things about backsplashes (tiled, painted, papered, anything!) is deciding where to stop. In some kitchens, there will be doors, trim, appliances, molding, or ends of counter top that make it very clear where the wallpaper installation should end. Other times, it’s not as evident.\\nMy original plan was to only tile the backsplash, and I used the width of our countertop and the height of the cabinets as my guide (as seen below).\\n\\nBut even as I stepped back, put my supplies away, and called the job done, the “tiling” really bothered me. The white paper felt random in the context of the rest of the kitchen; and instead of my eye drifting to the pretty paper, it kept drifting to the ceiling where there was none. Below is a quick snapshot I took as I debated (for weeks!) what to do about it.\\n\\nI finally decided that I needed to extend the wallpaper up the wall to the ceiling in order to make it work. After a quick calculation, I determined I had enough paper leftover to cover the remaining wall (I originally bought enough to “tile” the fireplace in the adjoining family room too).\\n\\nThe wonderful thing about installing wallpaper above cabinets is that there is usually nothing to work around…no outlets, no lights! As such, I just cut the paper into strips and put it right up, matching the pattern as I went around the kitchen.\\n\\nWe lived with just the backsplash area done for about 2 months before I finally did the rest of the wall, and to say the change was dramatic is an understatement. The wallpapered backsplash went from feeling random and disjointed to providing a fun and fresh detail that really woke up the entire kitchen.\\nIf your cabinets do not reach the ceiling or a soffit, I highly recommend wallpapering the area above the cabinets for the most visual impact.\\n\\n\\nIn the three years we lived in this house, I was never\\xa0really able to get used to the brown cabinets and brown counters and brown floors. But the small temporary changes I was able to make (like the wallpapered backsplash and this simple window valance) truly helped me like the space a lot more than the dull cave we started with. Although this wallpaper backsplash wasn’t the easiest DIY I’ve taken on, it was certainly one of the most rewarding!\\n\\nOther Renter-Friendly Kitchen Updates\\n\\nHow to Shiplap a Kitchen Island with Command Strips\\nA DIY Butcher Block Island Countertop (Anyone Can Do!)\\nAn Easy Way to Add Pattern to Your Pantry with Wrapping Paper\\n\\nWhether you rent or own, I suspect most of us have aspects of our homes we just don’t love.

It makes such a difference. Here’s another suggestion for you. Chalkboard vinyl on the panels of your cabinet doors. My son-in-law suggested that I paint my doors with the chalkboard paint, but I couldn’t bring myself to do something so permanent. I found the vinyl online though, on some sort of deal, and I LOVE IT. It is fun to label my cabinets, and it would cut way back on the brown in your kitchen. (I think it would coordinate with the black on your fridge and appliances, too.) Anyway, just a suggestion.

Most peel-and-stick papers are like a thick contact paper, so they can easily be wiped clean.

And we have lived in North Carolina, Kansas, California and Virginia. That said, I would ALWAYS do a test on any wall and leave it up for a while before you do a full installation.\\nThird, most peel-and-stick wallpapers are wipeable/washable. So if the wallpaper DOES stay up, you’d be able to clean it without any issue. The white wallpaper in this post was wiped down with a wet rag constantly.\\nFinally, if you determine you do need something over the wallpaper, some sort of plexiglass/acrylic sheet could work (although it would be pricey) or you could try clear contact paper.\\xa0\\nHope those thoughts help a bit!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDS53 — October 12, 2020 @ 9:46 pm Reply\\nYou are so very inspiring!\\n\\n\\nthehomesihavemade — October 16, 2020 @ 8:51 am Reply\\nThanks so much…glad you stopped by!\\nMegan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShonda — April 14, 2022 @ 10:58 am Reply\\nAny thoughts on how you would manage an outside corner with wallpaper?\\n\\n\\nMegan — April 14, 2022 @ 12:03 pm Reply\\nHi Shonda!\\nI’m not sure what you mean by outside corner…do you mean one that protrudes outward rather than in?\\nI actually think paper bends easier around a protruding\\xa0corner, but it will still be tricky to keep it perfectly level. I’d give it a try going around the corner first. If you can’t get the follow-on paper to line up level, then you could technically cut it at the corner and start over, but you run the risk of the seam being really visible.\\xa0\\nIf you cut your paper 1-2″ taller than you need, you’d be able to turn the corner and not have any gap between the paper and the upper cabinets, even if it does go a little off as you make the bend.\\nDoes that help?\\nThanks!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContent Sidebar\\n\\nHi, I'm Megan!\\nI am a military spouse, mom to 3 young boys, and a constant creator.

It’s also available at Wallpops. This is not the peel & stick tiles. It’s actually an 18 inch by 9 foot roll of peel and stick wallpaper. The scale of the pattern and the height of the roll were designed to work perfectly as a backsplash.\\nORIGINAL DESIGN & PLAN\\nTwo years ago, I designed and installed Ikea kitchen cabinets and counter-tops in my home office. You can read all about that process here. I love the design, storage and function of this space. But, I was worn out with the build and came up short with the decor.\\n\\nWhile I did make a small effort to decorate my office at the time, I wasn’t satisfied with the outcome. This month I plan to use my DIY skills and material I already have, to decorate it. I want to save my budget for other projects, so I don’t plan to spend much on this.\\nWhen I first installed the cabinets, I made a fabric pin board in this space. As time passed, I realized that I wasn’t using the cork board and the color and pattern didn’t really match the rest of my home. I also have plans to use the cork board in a different way.

If your wall is freshly painted, hold off on applying the wallpaper. I would advise waiting for 4 weeks to let the paint fully cure. The wall surface needs to be clean and smooth. Do not attempt to apply wallpaper to textured walls, unpainted drywall or non-stick paint. If you are hanging it around outlets or switches, turn off the power, remove the covers and vacuum out any dust. You don’t want to get dust or debris on the adhesive backing of the wallpaper. I also don’t advise applying the wallpaper over caulk.\\nHOW TO APPLY A WALLPAPER BACKSPLASH\\nFirst I’m going to explain what the instructions said to do. Then I’m going to explain what I actually did and why.\\nPACKAGE INSTRUCTIONS\\n\\nStart with a smaller piece of wallpaper. Lay your roll of wallpaper on the counter and peel back about 12 inches of the backing.\\n\\nWorking from left to right, apply the wallpaper, starting at an edge or corner. Use your counter-top as a guide for level. Once it is positioned properly, smooth out and press it firmly with your plastic spreader. Again working from left to right.\\n\\nMeasure and cut out any outlets or switch covers with your cutting mat and utility knife.\\nTake care not to stretch the paper. HGTV has a quick and simple video for the process, if you need to see it.\\nHOW I ACTUALLY INSTALLED THE WALLPAPER BACKSPLASH\\nI had a few obstacles that prevented the above method from working. First, I have a piece of molding on the front of my upper cabinets to hide the cabinet lighting. The molding and lighting ended up being a big problem.\\nWhile I started out using the recommended method, the edges of my wallpaper were getting damaged. The wallpaper also began heading in a downward motion, because I had to unroll it on a slight angle. Thankfully, this paper was removable. So I peeled it off and came up with a new plan.\\nI laid the paper face down on my counter-top and peeled off the entire backing.\\n\\nThen I asked two of my kids to hold the paper up, while I positioned it and used my plastic spreader to smooth it out. Be sure to explain the process to your helpers first. I asked them to be careful, not to let the adhesive stick to itself before they lifted the paper.\\n\\nEven though this process sounds awkward, I have to say it, it was much easier. I had the paper up very quickly, it wasn’t damaged and it was level. I didn’t have to work around outlets, so I only had one seam. If you are measuring and cutting outlets, work with smaller pieces of wallpaper. I’ll explain how I hid the seams further down.\\nIS IT EASY TO INSTALL?\\nMany people hear peel & stick and think this is a simple project. Like any DIY project, patience will serve you well. There are always obstacles to work around and it’s never as strait forward as you originally think.\\nWith that said, I would put this project in the easy category. Give yourself enough margin, so you are not rushing through it.\\nIS IT A QUALITY PAPER?\\nThe paper I used was very good quality. It was on the thicker side and didn’t tear when I had to remove it from the wall. It has a matte vinyl feel. The two rolls were consistent in color and pattern. The edge of a new roll is designed to line up with the end of the previous roll. Although, I found mine to be slightly off. I’ll explain how I lined up the seams further down.\\nDOES IT STICK WELL?\\nIf you have a clean, smooth surface, it does stick well. I was very impressed with the adhesive on this wallpaper. It stuck firmly to the wall and was easy to smooth out during application. There are no bubbles or wrinkles and it is firmly stuck to the wall.\\nDO YOU OVERLAP IT?\\nThe instruction say to line up the ends of the wall paper, matching the pattern up. I tried to do it this way and found that the seam showed and the pattern was slightly off. Keep in mind, I’m a very detail oriented person.\\nMy fix? I overlapped the pattern. I want to be honest here. In all of my research, no one recommended to do this. I’m also not sure if this will be a problem over time. But, I have to say that the seam is invisible. I called my kids in and asked them to find the seam without touching the wallpaper. They couldn’t find it, even with careful attention. The black arrows below are pointing to the seam.\\n\\nI cut the wallpaper so the seam didn’t run through any of the dark gray solid lines. The adhesive stuck really well to the front of the previous piece of paper. If I were wallpapering an entire wall, I’m not sure I would have the patience to do this.\\nHOW DO YOU CLEAN A WALLPAPER BACKSPLASH?\\nThe directions say to wipe it down with a slightly damp cloth. It has a vinyl type finish on it, so I think it will wipe up well. However, I’m not sure spaghetti sauce would wipe off of it. Certain foods or smoke from cooking, might stain the white finish. I’m using it in an office environment, so I won’t be able to test it for you.\\nTo be fair, it is a very inexpensive product and is designed for temporary use. That’s why it’s removable. It’s also pretty simple to install. I feel certain, that if I tire of it after a few years, I can install a new paper without breaking the bank or wasting too much time.\\nIS IT REALLY REMOVABLE?\\nI did stick down about 3 feet of this paper and then removed it. It stuck really well to the wall. When I pulled it off, the paper didn’t tear and all of the adhesive came up with the paper. There was no damage to the paint or wall.\\nSince I haven’t tested removing it after it’s been up for a few years, I cannot speak to that. I do know from working with removable vinyl in my crafts, the adhesive becomes more permanent over time. Especially if it is in direct sunlight or if it comes into contact with heat. I’m not sure if this wallpaper is the same as removable vinyl. But I thought you would find this information helpful.\\nDO YOU NEED TO TRIM IT OUT WITH MOLDING?\\nAfter installing the wallpaper, I found that it looked O.K. without molding around it. There was no need to install trim. Here is a picture before the molding.\\n\\nI like the way it looks with molding. There is a gap between the back of my counter-top and the wall. Most kitchens have caulk in this gap. Since my counter-tops are in an office (dry environment) I didn’t caulk the gap. If you are in a kitchen, you will need stop the wallpaper before the caulk line. I’m not sure how this will look. You may want to remove the caulk, install the wallpaper and then re-caulk it.\\n\\nAnother option would be to stop the wallpaper before the caulk and apply a piece of cove molding over it. Since the molding is light and just decorative, I used double stick tape and a thin line of caulk to hold the molding in place. This held up well and I didn’t put a bunch of holes in the wall and molding with a brad nailer.\\nJOIN THE COMMUNITY\\nFor instant access to my free library and regular updates on blog posts, subscribe at the top sidebar or at the bottom of this post.

See my full disclosure statement\\xa0here.\\nI’m sure that different brands vary in quality. While I cannot speak for all brands, I’m sharing my experience with this particular wallpaper.\\nSome questions I plan to cover are:\\n\\nIs it easy to install?\\nIs it a quality paper?\\nDoes it stick well?\\nDo you overlap it?\\nHow do you clean a wallpaper backsplash?\\nIs it really removable?\\n\\nYou can find the wallpaper pattern I used on Amazon. It’s also available at Wallpops. This is not the peel & stick tiles. It’s actually an 18 inch by 9 foot roll of peel and stick wallpaper. The scale of the pattern and the height of the roll were designed to work perfectly as a backsplash.\\nORIGINAL DESIGN & PLAN\\nTwo years ago, I designed and installed Ikea kitchen cabinets and counter-tops in my home office. You can read all about that process here. I love the design, storage and function of this space. But, I was worn out with the build and came up short with the decor.\\n\\nWhile I did make a small effort to decorate my office at the time, I wasn’t satisfied with the outcome. This month I plan to use my DIY skills and material I already have, to decorate it. I want to save my budget for other projects, so I don’t plan to spend much on this.\\nWhen I first installed the cabinets, I made a fabric pin board in this space. As time passed, I realized that I wasn’t using the cork board and the color and pattern didn’t really match the rest of my home. I also have plans to use the cork board in a different way. This is where I’m starting.\\n\\nSUPPLIES NEEDED\\n\\nREMOVABLE PEEL & STICK WALLPAPER BACKSPLASH\\n” target=”_blank”>PLASTIC SPREADER\\nX-ACTO KNIFE\\nTAPE MEASURE\\nCUTTING MAT (OPTIONAL)\\n\\n\\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN\\nLet’s cover a few important things up front. If your wall is freshly painted, hold off on applying the wallpaper. I would advise waiting for 4 weeks to let the paint fully cure. The wall surface needs to be clean and smooth. Do not attempt to apply wallpaper to textured walls, unpainted drywall or non-stick paint. If you are hanging it around outlets or switches, turn off the power, remove the covers and vacuum out any dust. You don’t want to get dust or debris on the adhesive backing of the wallpaper.

The instructions for installing a washable wallpaper backsplash are the same, but since the original post, we have updated the backsplash with new wallpaper.\\nAt the end of the DIY, you will see not only how easy this washable backsplash is to install, but also how easy it is to change it when you fancy a new design. There are examples of making waterproof wallpaper splashbacks in the bathroom, plus other wallpaper decorating ideas for the home.\\nIn the UK my friends say the word backsplash, the other way around, splashback. Having been bought up in 2 cultures, I’m happy using the word either way.\\nI know you can get washable vinyl wallpaper, which is sometimes used as a kitchen backsplash, but they are limited in designs. With this method, we use for making a wallpaper kitchen backsplash you can use any wallpaper. It doesn’t have to be waterproof either.\\nDIY Kitchen Wallpaper Backsplash (splashback) with wallpaper\\nMy friend had spotted some gorgeous Dragonfly wallpaper by Harlequin. Even though it wasn’t a wallpaper specially designed for kitchens, she was determined to have it. That’s when we worked out the best way to make a kitchen wallpaper splashback (backsplash).\\nThe wallpaper is protected by a piece of glass and is screwed to the wall. The really awesome thing about this DIY splashback is that it’s really easy to unscrew the glass and change the wallpaper when you feel like something different.\\nYou could even put something other than wallpaper behind the glass, such as a photo collage, or other images printed on paper. I’m a huge fan of decorating and crafting with old maps, so I would be tempted to use an old map for my kitchen backsplash. However, I can see myself getting distracted by the map, instead of concentrating on my cooking.\\n\\nWe’re a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.\\nWhat you need\\n\\nWallpaper – Depending on the size of your kitchen splashback (backsplash) and how your wallpaper pattern fits will determine how much wallpaper you use. Usually, you would need no more than a quarter roll. The wallpaper we used was a Harlequin Wallpaper, Palmetto Demoiselle, which comes in several different colorways, eBay is a great place to look for odd or even part rolls of wallpaper.\\nWallpaper paste/adhesive – I recommend using a wallpaper paste that has anti-fungal properties. You can buy an anti-fungal agent to add the adhesive. This will help stop the wallpaper from going moldy with any kitchen condensation.\\nRotary cutter and mat\\nPlywood base – This will need to be the size of your DIY splashback. We used a 5.5mm hardwood ply.\\nGlass – This again will be the size of your kitchen backsplash. We used a 4mm toughened low iron glass which we got cut to size at the store. We also had 4 screw holes drilled into each corner of the glass at the store. Make sure the glass is heatproof safety glass.\\nDomed mirror screws – 4, one for each corner.\\nTile trim – The size of the trim depends on the thickness of the backsplash. We used a 12mm wrap round trim in chrome. You don’t have to have a trim, it’s mainly about aesthetics. This can be purchased from your local tiling store.\\n\\n\\nHow to make your DIY Splashback\\nStep1: First, carefully measure the exact area of where you would like the kitchen backsplash to be. Ours was a square just above the cooker hob.\\nWe were installing the wallpapered backsplash on a newly fitted kitchen with a freshly plastered and painted blank wall.\\n\\nStep 2. Take these measurements to your local DIY/Home store and get the plywood and glass cut to the size. At the same time get them to drill the screw holes into the corner of the glass.\\n\\nStep 3. Next, carefully think about how your wallpaper pattern design will fit on the backsplash before cutting it to the measurements. With the dragonfly wallpaper design, we wanted whole dragonflies in the middle of the backsplash. Therefore, we ended up with one wallpaper roll width in the middle and two-part widths on either side.\\n\\nStep 4. Next, to make sure that the wallpaper will stick firmly, key your plywood. Do this by coating the cut plywood with a layer of wallpaper paste and leaving it to dry.\\n\\nStep 5. Once the key has dried, paste the board again with wallpaper paste. Then stick the wallpaper sheets down one at a time. Make sure the pattern lines up properly. Use a wallpaper roller to squeeze out any air bubbles. Leave the wallpaper to dry thoroughly.\\n\\nAttaching the backsplash to the wall and making it waterproof\\nStep 6. Next, comes the tricky bit of attaching the plywood and glass to the wall. You will probably need more than one pair of hands for this stage. Attach the plywood and glass to the wall at the same time using the same mirror screws.\\nMeasure where the screw holes will need to be in the wall and then drill the holes and add the appropriate wall plug. Do the same with the wallpapered plywood.\\nThe mirror screws go through the glass and wallpapered plywood and then into the wall at the back.

Finally, the wallpapered kitchen backsplash has a raw edge, to neaten this up we fitted a chrome tile trim.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow To Change The Wallpaper\\nAfter six years of the dragonfly wallpaper as a backsplash, it was time for a change. The back wall in the kitchen had been wallpapered with a Lucy Tiffney wallpaper and my friend Wendy wanted the backsplash to match.\\n\\nStep 1: The first thing to do was to remove the old backsplash. This only took about 10 minutes. First, the chrome trim was removed from the edges of the glass. They just simply slid out. Next, the four screws were removed from the glass and the glass plate lifted away.\\n\\nStep 2: The plywood back with the dragonfly wallpaper was laid down on the counter. We didn’t bother removing the old wallpaper but just stuck the new design on top of the old. As with the original backsplash, we made sure the pattern matched up. We used the same adhesive and technique as above.\\n\\n\\nStep 3: Once the new wallpaper has dried, screw it all back into the wall with the same glass front as before. Then slide the chrome trim back into place. It’s really that easy and takes less than an hour to change the wallpaper backsplash.\\n\\nFAQs About This DIY and Kitchen\\nWhy glass instead of plexiglass (plastic)?\\nPlexiglass scratches very easily, crazes and is much more difficult to clean well. Also, plexiglass will melt with the heat and collect grease. Glass is more heat-resistant and is easy enough to clean. The cost is about on par with the plexiglass. Make sure you use heatproof safety glass.\\nDo you have to have special heat resistant glass?\\nIt was safety glass and a low iron glass to avoid a green tint.\\nWhere did you get the glass and how much did it cost for a piece that large?\\nIt was from a local builders merchant in the UK and cost about £100 ($140), which included the pre-drilled holes.\\nHow has it held up to the heat from the stove?\\nThe wallpaper has been up for almost five years now and it still looks as good as the day it was installed.

With so many fantastic wallpaper designs available, you will easily find something that would look amazing in your kitchen. I know that when I eventually get a new kitchen, I will have a DIY wallpaper splashback.

The instructions for installing a washable wallpaper backsplash are the same, but since the original post, we have updated the backsplash with new wallpaper.\\nAt the end of the DIY, you will see not only how easy this washable backsplash is to install, but also how easy it is to change it when you fancy a new design. There are examples of making waterproof wallpaper splashbacks in the bathroom, plus other wallpaper decorating ideas for the home.\\nIn the UK my friends say the word backsplash, the other way around, splashback. Having been bought up in 2 cultures, I’m happy using the word either way.\\nI know you can get washable vinyl wallpaper, which is sometimes used as a kitchen backsplash, but they are limited in designs. With this method, we use for making a wallpaper kitchen backsplash you can use any wallpaper. It doesn’t have to be waterproof either.\\nDIY Kitchen Wallpaper Backsplash (splashback) with wallpaper\\nMy friend had spotted some gorgeous Dragonfly wallpaper by Harlequin. Even though it wasn’t a wallpaper specially designed for kitchens, she was determined to have it. That’s when we worked out the best way to make a kitchen wallpaper splashback (backsplash).\\nThe wallpaper is protected by a piece of glass and is screwed to the wall. The really awesome thing about this DIY splashback is that it’s really easy to unscrew the glass and change the wallpaper when you feel like something different.\\nYou could even put something other than wallpaper behind the glass, such as a photo collage, or other images printed on paper. I’m a huge fan of decorating and crafting with old maps, so I would be tempted to use an old map for my kitchen backsplash. However, I can see myself getting distracted by the map, instead of concentrating on my cooking.\\n\\nWe’re a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.\\nWhat you need\\n\\nWallpaper – Depending on the size of your kitchen splashback (backsplash) and how your wallpaper pattern fits will determine how much wallpaper you use. Usually, you would need no more than a quarter roll. The wallpaper we used was a Harlequin Wallpaper, Palmetto Demoiselle, which comes in several different colorways, eBay is a great place to look for odd or even part rolls of wallpaper.\\nWallpaper paste/adhesive – I recommend using a wallpaper paste that has anti-fungal properties. You can buy an anti-fungal agent to add the adhesive. This will help stop the wallpaper from going moldy with any kitchen condensation.\\nRotary cutter and mat\\nPlywood base – This will need to be the size of your DIY splashback. We used a 5.5mm hardwood ply.\\nGlass – This again will be the size of your kitchen backsplash. We used a 4mm toughened low iron glass which we got cut to size at the store. We also had 4 screw holes drilled into each corner of the glass at the store. Make sure the glass is heatproof safety glass.\\nDomed mirror screws – 4, one for each corner.\\nTile trim – The size of the trim depends on the thickness of the backsplash. We used a 12mm wrap round trim in chrome. You don’t have to have a trim, it’s mainly about aesthetics. This can be purchased from your local tiling store.\\n\\n\\nHow to make your DIY Splashback\\nStep1: First, carefully measure the exact area of where you would like the kitchen backsplash to be. Ours was a square just above the cooker hob.\\nWe were installing the wallpapered backsplash on a newly fitted kitchen with a freshly plastered and painted blank wall.\\n\\nStep 2. Take these measurements to your local DIY/Home store and get the plywood and glass cut to the size. At the same time get them to drill the screw holes into the corner of the glass.\\n\\nStep 3. Next, carefully think about how your wallpaper pattern design will fit on the backsplash before cutting it to the measurements. With the dragonfly wallpaper design, we wanted whole dragonflies in the middle of the backsplash. Therefore, we ended up with one wallpaper roll width in the middle and two-part widths on either side.\\n\\nStep 4. Next, to make sure that the wallpaper will stick firmly, key your plywood. Do this by coating the cut plywood with a layer of wallpaper paste and leaving it to dry.\\n\\nStep 5. Once the key has dried, paste the board again with wallpaper paste. Then stick the wallpaper sheets down one at a time. Make sure the pattern lines up properly. Use a wallpaper roller to squeeze out any air bubbles.

AI is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. For modern developments in AI, see artificial intelligence.\\nAlan Turing and the beginning of AI\\nTheoretical work\\nThe earliest substantial work in the field of artificial intelligence was done in the mid-20th century by the British logician and computer pioneer Alan Mathison Turing. In 1935 Turing described an abstract computing machine consisting of a limitless memory and a scanner that moves back and forth through the memory, symbol by symbol, reading what it finds and writing further symbols. The actions of the scanner are dictated by a program of instructions that also is stored in the memory in the form of symbols. This is Turing’s stored-program concept, and implicit in it is the possibility of the machine operating on, and so modifying or improving, its own program. Turing’s conception is now known simply as the universal Turing machine. All modern computers are in essence universal Turing machines.\\nDuring World War II Turing was a leading cryptanalyst at the Government Code and Cypher School in Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, England. Turing could not turn to the project of building a stored-program electronic computing machine until the cessation of hostilities in Europe in 1945. Nevertheless, during the war he gave considerable thought to the issue of machine intelligence. One of Turing’s colleagues at Bletchley Park, Donald Michie (who later founded the Department of Machine Intelligence and Perception at the University of Edinburgh), later recalled that Turing often discussed how computers could learn from experience as well as solve new problems through the use of guiding principles—a process now known as heuristic problem solving.\\nTuring gave quite possibly the earliest public lecture (London, 1947) to mention computer intelligence, saying, “What we want is a machine that can learn from experience,” and that the “possibility of letting the machine alter its own instructions provides the mechanism for this.” In 1948 he introduced many of the central concepts of AI in a report entitled “Intelligent Machinery.” However, Turing did not publish this paper, and many of his ideas were later reinvented by others. For instance, one of Turing’s original ideas was to train a network of artificial neurons to perform specific tasks, an approach described in the section Connectionism.\\nChess\\nAt Bletchley Park Turing illustrated his ideas on machine intelligence by reference to chess—a useful source of challenging and clearly defined problems against which proposed methods for problem solving could be tested. In principle, a chess-playing computer could play by searching exhaustively through all the available moves, but in practice this is impossible because it would involve examining an astronomically large number of moves. Heuristics are necessary to guide a narrower, more discriminative search. Although Turing experimented with designing chess programs, he had to content himself with theory in the absence of a computer to run his chess program. The first true AI programs had to await the arrival of stored-program electronic digital computers.\\n\\nGarry Kasparov playing against Deep BlueWorld chess champion Garry Kasparov (left) taking a pawn in the opening minutes of a six-game, six-day chess match against IBM\\'s Deep Blue computer in Philadelphia, February 10, 1996. Feng-hsiung Hsu (right), the principal designer of Deep Blue, keys a move into the computer. The computer, capable of computing 200 million positions per second, was powerful enough to be comparable to Kasparov in its level of play. Kasparov beat Deep Blue 4–2 but lost in a rematch the following year 3 ½–2 ½.(more)\\nIn 1945 Turing predicted that computers would one day play very good chess, and just over 50 years later, in 1997, Deep Blue, a chess computer built by IBM (International Business Machines Corporation), beat the reigning world champion, Garry Kasparov, in a six-game match. While Turing’s prediction came true, his expectation that chess programming would contribute to the understanding of how human beings think did not. The huge improvement in computer chess since Turing’s day is attributable to advances in computer engineering rather than advances in AI: Deep Blue’s 256 parallel processors enabled it to examine 200 million possible moves per second and to look ahead as many as 14 turns of play. Many agree with Noam Chomsky, a linguist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who opined that a computer beating a grandmaster at chess is about as interesting as a bulldozer winning an Olympic weightlifting competition.\\nThe Turing test\\nIn 1950 Turing sidestepped the traditional debate concerning the definition of intelligence by introducing a practical test for computer intelligence that is now known simply as the Turing test. The Turing test involves three participants: a computer, a human interrogator, and a human foil. The interrogator attempts to determine, by asking questions of the other two participants, which is the computer. All communication is via keyboard and display screen. The interrogator may ask questions as penetrating and wide-ranging as necessary, and the computer is permitted to do everything possible to force a wrong identification. (For instance, the computer might answer “No” in response to “Are you a computer?” and might follow a request to multiply one large number by another with a long pause and an incorrect answer.) The foil must help the interrogator to make a correct identification. A number of different people play the roles of interrogator and foil, and, if a sufficient proportion of the interrogators are unable to distinguish the computer from the human being, then (according to proponents of Turing’s test) the computer is considered an intelligent, thinking entity.\\n\\nAre you a student?\\nGet a special academic rate on Britannica Premium.\\nSubscribe\\nIn 1991 the American philanthropist Hugh Loebner started the annual Loebner Prize competition, promising $100,000 to the first computer to pass the Turing test and awarding $2,000 each year to the best effort. However, no AI program has come close to passing an undiluted Turing test. In late 2022 the advent of the large language model ChatGPT reignited conversation about the likelihood that the components of the Turing test had been met. BuzzFeed data scientist Max Woolf said that ChatGPT had passed the Turing test in December 2022, but some experts claim that ChatGPT did not pass a true Turing test, because, in ordinary usage, ChatGPT often states that it is a language model.\\nEarly milestones in AI\\nThe first AI programs\\nThe earliest successful AI program was written in 1951 by Christopher Strachey, later director of the Programming Research Group at the University of Oxford. Strachey’s checkers (draughts) program ran on the Ferranti Mark I computer at the University of Manchester, England. By the summer of 1952 this program could play a complete game of checkers at a reasonable speed.\\nInformation about the earliest successful demonstration of machine learning was published in 1952. Shopper, written by Anthony Oettinger at the University of Cambridge, ran on the EDSAC computer. Shopper’s simulated world was a mall of eight shops. When instructed to purchase an item, Shopper would search for it, visiting shops at random until the item was found. While searching, Shopper would memorize a few of the items stocked in each shop visited (just as a human shopper might). The next time Shopper was sent out for the same item, or for some other item that it had already located, it would go to the right shop straight away. This simple form of learning is called rote learning.\\nThe first AI program to run in the United States also was a checkers program, written in 1952 by Arthur Samuel for the prototype of the IBM 701. Samuel took over the essentials of Strachey’s checkers program and over a period of years considerably extended it. In 1955 he added features that enabled the program to learn from experience. Samuel included mechanisms for both rote learning and generalization, enhancements that eventually led to his program’s winning one game against a former Connecticut checkers champion in 1962.\\nEvolutionary computing\\nSamuel’s checkers program was also notable for being one of the first efforts at evolutionary computing. (His program “evolved” by pitting a modified copy against the current best version of his program, with the winner becoming the new standard.) Evolutionary computing typically involves the use of some automatic method of generating and evaluating successive “generations” of a program, until a highly proficient solution evolves.\\nA leading proponent of evolutionary computing, John Holland, also wrote test software for the prototype of the IBM 701 computer. In particular, he helped design a neural-network virtual rat that could be trained to navigate through a maze. This work convinced Holland of the efficacy of the bottom-up approach to AI, which involves creating neural networks in imitation of the brain’s structure. While continuing to consult for IBM, Holland moved to the University of Michigan in 1952 to pursue a doctorate in mathematics. He soon switched, however, to a new interdisciplinary program in computers and information processing (later known as communications science) created by Arthur Burks, one of the builders of ENIAC and its successor EDVAC. In his 1959 dissertation, for what was likely the world’s first computer science Ph.D., Holland proposed a new type of computer—a multiprocessor computer—that would assign each artificial neuron in a network to a separate processor. (In 1985 Daniel Hillis solved the engineering difficulties to build the first such computer, the 65,536-processor Thinking Machines Corporation supercomputer.)\\nHolland joined the faculty at Michigan after graduation and over the next four decades directed much of the research into methods of automating evolutionary computing, a process now known by the term genetic algorithms. Systems implemented in Holland’s laboratory included a chess program, models of single-cell biological organisms, and a classifier system for controlling a simulated gas-pipeline network. Genetic algorithms are no longer restricted to academic demonstrations, however; in one important practical application, a genetic algorithm cooperates with a witness to a crime in order to generate a portrait of the perpetrator.\\nLogical reasoning and problem solving\\nThe ability to reason logically is an important aspect of intelligence and has always been a major focus of AI research. An important landmark in this area was a theorem-proving program written in 1955–56 by Allen Newell and J. Clifford Shaw of the RAND Corporation and Herbert Simon of Carnegie Mellon University. The Logic Theorist, as the program became known, was designed to prove theorems from Principia Mathematica (1910–13), a three-volume work by the British philosopher-mathematicians Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell. In one instance, a proof devised by the program was more elegant than the proof given in the books.\\nNewell, Simon, and Shaw went on to write a more powerful program, the General Problem Solver, or GPS. The first version of GPS ran in 1957, and work continued on the project for about a decade. GPS could solve an impressive variety of puzzles using a trial and error approach. However, one criticism of GPS, and similar programs that lack any learning capability, is that the program’s intelligence is entirely secondhand, coming from whatever information the programmer explicitly includes.\\nEnglish dialogue\\nTwo of the best-known early AI programs, Eliza and Parry, gave an eerie semblance of intelligent conversation. (Details of both were first published in 1966.) Eliza, written by Joseph Weizenbaum of MIT’s AI Laboratory, simulated a human therapist. Parry, written by Stanford University psychiatrist Kenneth Colby, simulated a human experiencing paranoia. Psychiatrists who were asked to decide whether they were communicating with Parry or a human experiencing paranoia were often unable to tell. Nevertheless, neither Parry nor Eliza could reasonably be described as intelligent. Parry’s contributions to the conversation were canned—constructed in advance by the programmer and stored away in the computer’s memory. Eliza, too, relied on canned sentences and simple programming tricks.\\nAI programming languages\\nIn the course of their work on the Logic Theorist and GPS, Newell, Simon, and Shaw developed their Information Processing Language (IPL), a computer language tailored for AI programming. At the heart of IPL was a highly flexible data structure that they called a list. A list is simply an ordered sequence of items of data. Some or all of the items in a list may themselves be lists. This scheme leads to richly branching structures.\\nIn 1960 John McCarthy combined elements of IPL with the lambda calculus (a formal mathematical-logical system) to produce the programming language LISP (List Processor), which for decades was the principal language for AI work in the United States, before it was supplanted in the 21st century by such languages as Python, Java, and C++. (The lambda calculus itself was invented in 1936 by Princeton logician Alonzo Church while he was investigating the abstract Entscheidungsproblem, or “decision problem,” for predicate logic—the same problem that Turing had been attacking when he invented the universal Turing machine.)\\nThe logic programming language PROLOG (Programmation en Logique) was conceived by Alain Colmerauer at the University of Aix-Marseille, France, where the language was first implemented in 1973. PROLOG was further developed by the logician Robert Kowalski, a member of the AI group at the University of Edinburgh. This language makes use of a powerful theorem-proving technique known as resolution, invented in 1963 at the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission’s Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois by the British logician Alan Robinson. PROLOG can determine whether or not a given statement follows logically from other given statements. For example, given the statements “All logicians are rational” and “Robinson is a logician,” a PROLOG program responds in the affirmative to the query “Robinson is rational?” PROLOG was widely used for AI work, especially in Europe and Japan.\\nMicroworld programs\\nTo cope with the bewildering complexity of the real world, scientists often ignore less relevant details; for instance, physicists often ignore friction and elasticity in their models. In 1970 Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert of the MIT AI Laboratory proposed that, likewise, AI research should focus on developing programs capable of intelligent behavior in simpler artificial environments known as microworlds. Much research has focused on the so-called blocks world, which consists of colored blocks of various shapes and sizes arrayed on a flat surface.\\nAn early success of the microworld approach was SHRDLU, written by Terry Winograd of MIT. (Details of the program were published in 1972.) SHRDLU controlled a robot arm that operated above a flat surface strewn with play blocks. Both the arm and the blocks were virtual. SHRDLU would respond to commands typed in natural English, such as “Will you please stack up both of the red blocks and either a green cube or a pyramid.” The program could also answer questions about its own actions. Although SHRDLU was initially hailed as a major breakthrough, Winograd soon announced that the program was, in fact, a dead end. The techniques pioneered in the program proved unsuitable for application in wider, more interesting worlds. Moreover, the appearance that SHRDLU gave of understanding the blocks microworld, and English statements concerning it, was in fact an illusion. SHRDLU had no idea what a green block was.\\n\\nShakeyShakey, a mobile robot, was developed (1968–72) at the Stanford Research Institute, Menlo Park, California. The robot is equipped with a television camera, a range finder, and collision sensors that enable a minicomputer to control its actions remotely. Shakey can perform a few basic actions, such as go forward, turn, and push, albeit at a very slow pace. Contrasting colors, particularly the dark baseboard on each wall, help the robot to distinguish separate surfaces.(more)\\nAnother product of the microworld approach was Shakey, a mobile robot developed at the Stanford Research Institute by Bertram Raphael, Nils Nilsson, and others during the period 1968–72. The robot occupied a specially built microworld consisting of walls, doorways, and a few simply shaped wooden blocks. Each wall had a carefully painted baseboard to enable the robot to “see” where the wall met the floor (a simplification of reality that is typical of the microworld approach). Shakey had about a dozen basic abilities, such as TURN, PUSH, and CLIMB-RAMP. Critics pointed out the highly simplified nature of Shakey’s environment and emphasized that, despite these simplifications, Shakey operated excruciatingly slowly; a series of actions that a human could plan out and execute in minutes took Shakey days.\\nThe greatest success of the microworld approach is a type of program known as an expert system, described in the next section.\\nExpert systems\\nExpert systems occupy a type of microworld—for example, a model of a ship’s hold and its cargo—that is self-contained and relatively uncomplicated. For such AI systems every effort is made to incorporate all the information about some narrow field that an expert (or group of experts) would know, so that a good expert system can often outperform any single human expert. There are many commercial expert systems, including programs for medical diagnosis, chemical analysis, credit authorization, financial management, corporate planning, financial document routing, oil and mineral prospecting, genetic engineering, automobile design and manufacture, camera lens design, computer installation design, airline scheduling, cargo placement, and automatic help services for home computer owners.\\nKnowledge and inference\\nThe basic components of an expert system are a knowledge base, or KB, and an inference engine. The information to be stored in the KB is obtained by interviewing people who are expert in the area in question. The interviewer, or knowledge engineer, organizes the information elicited from the experts into a collection of rules, typically of an “if-then” structure. Rules of this type are called production rules. The inference engine enables the expert system to draw deductions from the rules in the KB. For example, if the KB contains the production rules “if x, then y” and “if y, then z,” the inference engine is able to deduce “if x, then z.” The expert system might then query its user, “Is x true in the situation that we are considering?” If the answer is affirmative, the system will proceed to infer z.\\nSome expert systems use fuzzy logic. In standard logic there are only two truth values, true and false. This absolute precision makes vague attributes or situations difficult to characterize. (For example, when, precisely, does a thinning head of hair become a bald head?) Often the rules that human experts use contain vague expressions, and so it is useful for an expert system’s inference engine to employ fuzzy logic.\\nDENDRAL\\nIn 1965 the AI researcher Edward Feigenbaum and the geneticist Joshua Lederberg, both of Stanford University, began work on Heuristic DENDRAL (later shortened to DENDRAL), a chemical-analysis expert system. The substance to be analyzed might, for example, be a complicated compound of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Starting from spectrographic data obtained from the substance, DENDRAL would hypothesize the substance’s molecular structure. DENDRAL’s performance rivaled that of chemists expert at this task, and the program was used in industry and in academia.\\nMYCIN\\nWork on MYCIN, an expert system for treating blood infections, began at Stanford University in 1972. MYCIN would attempt to diagnose patients based on reported symptoms and medical test results. The program could request further information concerning the patient, as well as suggest additional laboratory tests, to arrive at a probable diagnosis, after which it would recommend a course of treatment. If requested, MYCIN would explain the reasoning that led to its diagnosis and recommendation. Using about 500 production rules, MYCIN operated at roughly the same level of competence as human specialists in blood infections and rather better than general practitioners.\\nNevertheless, expert systems have no common sense or understanding of the limits of their expertise. For instance, if MYCIN were told that a patient who had received a gunshot wound was bleeding to death, the program would attempt to diagnose a bacterial cause for the patient’s symptoms. Expert systems can also act on absurd clerical errors, such as prescribing an obviously incorrect dosage of a drug for a patient whose weight and age data were accidentally transposed.\\nThe CYC project\\nCYC is a large experiment in symbolic AI. The project began in 1984 under the auspices of the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation, a consortium of computer, semiconductor, and electronics manufacturers. In 1995 Douglas Lenat, the CYC project director, spun off the project as Cycorp, Inc., based in Austin, Texas. The most ambitious goal of Cycorp was to build a KB containing a significant percentage of the commonsense knowledge of a human being. Millions of commonsense assertions, or rules, were coded into CYC. The expectation was that this “critical mass” would allow the system itself to extract further rules directly from ordinary prose and eventually serve as the foundation for future generations of expert systems.\\nWith only a fraction of its commonsense KB compiled, CYC could draw inferences that would defeat simpler systems. For example, CYC could infer, “Garcia is wet,” from the statement, “Garcia is finishing a marathon run,” by employing its rules that running a marathon entails high exertion, that people sweat at high levels of exertion, and that when something sweats, it is wet. Among the outstanding remaining problems are issues in searching and problem solving—for example, how to search the KB automatically for information that is relevant to a given problem. AI researchers call the problem of updating, searching, and otherwise manipulating a large structure of symbols in realistic amounts of time the frame problem. Some critics of symbolic AI believe that the frame problem is largely unsolvable and so maintain that the symbolic approach will never yield genuinely intelligent systems. It is possible that CYC, for example, will succumb to the frame problem long before the system achieves human levels of knowledge.'}, {'title': 'AI Timeline: Key Events in Artificial Intelligence from 1950-2025', 'url': 'https://www.theainavigator.com/ai-timeline', 'content': \"Welcome to our AI Timeline, a comprehensive journey through the history of artificial intelligence from 1950 to today.

The study of logic and formal reasoning from antiquity to the present led directly to the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on abstract mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired scientists to begin discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.\\nThe field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College in 1956.[1] Attendees of the workshop became the leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them predicted that machines as intelligent as humans would exist within a generation. The U.S. government provided millions of dollars with the hope of making this vision come true.[2]\\nEventually, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of this feat.[3] In 1974, criticism from James Lighthill and pressure from the U.S. Congress led the U.S. and British Governments to stop funding undirected research into artificial intelligence. Seven years later, a visionary initiative by the Japanese Government and the success of expert systems reinvigorated investment in AI, and by the late 1980s, the industry had grown into a billion-dollar enterprise. However, investors\\' enthusiasm waned in the 1990s, and the field was criticized in the press and avoided by industry (a period known as an \"AI winter\"). Nevertheless, research and funding continued to grow under other names.\\nIn the early 2000s, machine learning was applied to a wide range of problems in academia and industry. The success was due to the availability of powerful computer hardware, the collection of immense data sets, and the application of solid mathematical methods. Soon after, deep learning proved to be a breakthrough technology, eclipsing all other methods. The transformer architecture debuted in 2017 and was used to produce impressive generative AI applications, amongst other use cases.\\nInvestment in AI boomed in the 2020s. The recent AI boom, initiated by the development of transformer architecture, led to the rapid scaling and public releases of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. These models exhibit human-like traits of knowledge, attention, and creativity, and have been integrated into various sectors, fueling exponential investment in AI. However, concerns about the potential risks and ethical implications of advanced AI have also emerged, prompting debate about the future of AI and its impact on society.\\nPrecursors[edit]\\nMythical, fictional, and speculative precursors[edit]\\nMyth and legend[edit]\\nIn Greek mythology, Talos was a giant made of bronze who acted as guardian for the island of Crete. He would throw boulders at the ships of invaders and would complete 3 circuits around the island\\'s perimeter daily.[4] According to pseudo-Apollodorus\\' Bibliotheke, Hephaestus forged Talos with the aid of a cyclops and presented the automaton as a gift to Minos.[5] In the Argonautica, Jason and the Argonauts defeated Talos by removing a plug near his foot, causing the vital ichor to flow out from his body and rendering him lifeless.[6]\\nPygmalion was a legendary king and sculptor of Greek mythology, famously represented in Ovid\\'s Metamorphoses. In the 10th book of Ovid\\'s narrative poem, Pygmalion becomes disgusted with women when he witnesses the way in which the Propoetides prostitute themselves. Despite this, he makes offerings at the temple of Venus asking the goddess to bring to him a woman just like a statue he carved.[7]\\nMedieval legends of artificial beings[edit]\\nDepiction of a homunculus from Goethe\\'s Faust\\nIn Of the Nature of Things, the Swiss alchemist Paracelsus describes a procedure that he claims can fabricate an \"artificial man\". By placing the \"sperm of a man\" in horse dung, and feeding it the \"Arcanum of Mans blood\" after 40 days, the concoction will become a living infant.[8]\\nThe earliest written account regarding golem-making is found in the writings of Eleazar ben Judah of Worms in the early 13th century.[9] During the Middle Ages, it was believed that the animation of a Golem could be achieved by insertion of a piece of paper with any of God\\'s names on it, into the mouth of the clay figure.[10] Unlike legendary automata like Brazen Heads,[11] a Golem was unable to speak.[12]\\nTakwin, the artificial creation of life, was a frequent topic of Ismaili alchemical manuscripts, especially those attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan. Islamic alchemists attempted to create a broad range of life through their work, ranging from plants to animals.[13]\\nIn Faust: The Second Part of the Tragedy by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, an alchemically fabricated homunculus, destined to live forever in the flask in which he was made, endeavors to be born into a full human body. Upon the initiation of this transformation, however, the flask shatters and the homunculus dies.[14]\\nModern fiction[edit]\\nMain article: Artificial intelligence in fiction\\nBy the 19th century, ideas about artificial men and thinking machines became a popular theme in fiction. Notable works like Mary Shelley\\'s Frankenstein and Karel Čapek\\'s R.U.R. (Rossum\\'s Universal Robots)[15] explored the concept of artificial life. Speculative essays, such as Samuel Butler\\'s \"Darwin among the Machines\",[16] and Edgar Allan Poe\\'s \"Maelzel\\'s Chess Player\"[17] reflected society\\'s growing interest in machines with artificial intelligence. AI remains a common topic in science fiction today.[18]\\nAutomata[edit]\\nMain article: Automaton\\nAl-Jazari\\'s programmable automata (1206 CE)\\nRealistic humanoid automata were built by craftsman from many civilizations, including Yan Shi,[19] Hero of Alexandria,[20] Al-Jazari,[21] Haroun al-Rashid,[22] Jacques de Vaucanson,[23][24] Leonardo Torres y Quevedo,[25] Pierre Jaquet-Droz and Wolfgang von Kempelen.[26][27]\\nThe oldest known automata were the sacred statues of ancient Egypt and Greece.[28][29] The faithful believed that craftsman had imbued these figures with very real minds, capable of wisdom and emotion—Hermes Trismegistus wrote that \"by discovering the true nature of the gods, man has been able to reproduce it\".[30] English scholar Alexander Neckham asserted that the Ancient Roman poet Virgil had built a palace with automaton statues.[31]\\nDuring the early modern period, these legendary automata were said to possess the magical ability to answer questions put to them. The late medieval alchemist and proto-Protestant Roger Bacon was purported to have fabricated a brazen head, having developed a legend of having been a wizard.[32][33] These legends were similar to the Norse myth of the Head of Mímir. According to legend, Mímir was known for his intellect and wisdom, and was beheaded in the Æsir-Vanir War. Odin is said to have \"embalmed\" the head with herbs and spoke incantations over it such that Mímir\\'s head remained able to speak wisdom to Odin. Odin then kept the head near him for counsel.[34]\\nFormal reasoning[edit]\\nArtificial intelligence is based on the assumption that the process of human thought can be mechanized. The study of mechanical—or \"formal\"—reasoning has a long history. Chinese, Indian and Greek philosophers all developed structured methods of formal deduction by the first millennium BCE. Their ideas were developed over the centuries by philosophers such as Aristotle (who gave a formal analysis of the syllogism),[35] Euclid (whose Elements was a model of formal reasoning), al-Khwārizmī (who developed algebra and gave his name to the word algorithm) and European scholastic philosophers such as William of Ockham and Duns Scotus.[36]\\nSpanish philosopher Ramon Llull (1232–1315) developed several logical machines devoted to the production of knowledge by logical means;[37][38] Llull described his machines as mechanical entities that could combine basic and undeniable truths by simple logical operations, produced by the machine by mechanical meanings, in such ways as to produce all the possible knowledge.[39] Llull\\'s work had a great influence on Gottfried Leibniz, who redeveloped his ideas.[40]\\nGottfried Leibniz, who speculated that human reason could be reduced to mechanical calculation\\nIn the 17th century, Leibniz, Thomas Hobbes and René Descartes explored the possibility that all rational thought could be made as systematic as algebra or geometry.[41] Hobbes famously wrote in Leviathan: \"For reason ... is nothing but reckoning, that is adding and subtracting\".[42] Leibniz envisioned a universal language of reasoning, the characteristica universalis, which would reduce argumentation to calculation so that \"there would be no more need of disputation between two philosophers than between two accountants. For it would suffice to take their pencils in hand, down to their slates, and to say each other (with a friend as witness, if they liked): Let us calculate.\"[43] These philosophers had begun to articulate the physical symbol system hypothesis that would become the guiding faith of AI research.\\nThe study of mathematical logic provided the essential breakthrough that made artificial intelligence seem plausible. The foundations had been set by such works as Boole\\'s The Laws of Thought and Frege\\'s Begriffsschrift.[44] Building on Frege\\'s system, Russell and Whitehead presented a formal treatment of the foundations of mathematics in their masterpiece, the Principia Mathematica in 1913. Inspired by Russell\\'s success, David Hilbert challenged mathematicians of the 1920s and 30s to answer this fundamental question: \"can all of mathematical reasoning be formalized?\"[36] His question was answered by Gödel\\'s incompleteness proof,[45] Turing\\'s machine[45] and Church\\'s Lambda calculus.[a]\\nUS Army photo of the ENIAC at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering[47]\\nTheir answer was surprising in two ways. First, they proved that there were, in fact, limits to what mathematical logic could accomplish. But second (and more important for AI) their work suggested that, within these limits, any form of mathematical reasoning could be mechanized. The Church-Turing thesis implied that a mechanical device, shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1, could imitate any conceivable process of mathematical deduction.[45] The key insight was the Turing machine—a simple theoretical construct that captured the essence of abstract symbol manipulation.[48] This invention would inspire a handful of scientists to begin discussing the possibility of thinking machines.\\nComputer science[edit]\\nMain articles: History of computer hardware and History of computer science\\nCalculating machines were designed or built in antiquity and throughout history by many people, including Gottfried Leibniz,[38][49] Joseph Marie Jacquard,[50] Charles Babbage,[50][51] Percy Ludgate,[52] Leonardo Torres Quevedo,[53] Vannevar Bush,[54] and others. Ada Lovelace speculated that Babbage\\'s machine was \"a thinking or ... reasoning machine\", but warned \"It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that arise as to the powers\" of the machine.[55][56]\\nThe first modern computers were the massive machines of the Second World War (such as Konrad Zuse\\'s Z3, Alan Turing\\'s Heath Robinson and Colossus, Atanasoff and Berry\\'s ABC and ENIAC at the University of Pennsylvania).[57] ENIAC was based on the theoretical foundation laid by Alan Turing and developed by John von Neumann,[58] and proved to be the most influential.[57]\\nBirth of artificial intelligence (1941-56)[edit]\\nThe IBM 702: a computer used by the first generation of AI researchers.\\nThe earliest research into thinking machines was inspired by a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s. Recent research in neurology had shown that the brain was an electrical network of neurons that fired in all-or-nothing pulses. Norbert Wiener\\'s cybernetics described control and stability in electrical networks. Claude Shannon\\'s information theory described digital signals (i.e., all-or-nothing signals). Alan Turing\\'s theory of computation showed that any form of computation could be described digitally. The close relationship between these ideas suggested that it might be possible to construct an \"electronic brain\".\\nIn the 1940s and 50s, a handful of scientists from a variety of fields (mathematics, psychology, engineering, economics and political science) explored several research directions that would be vital to later AI research.[59] Alan Turing was among the first people to seriously investigate the theoretical possibility of \"machine intelligence\".[60] The field of \"artificial intelligence research\" was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.[61]\\nTuring test[62]\\nTuring Test[edit]\\nMain article: Turing test\\nIn 1950 Turing published a landmark paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which he speculated about the possibility of creating machines that think.[63][b] In the paper, he noted that \"thinking\" is difficult to define and devised his famous Turing Test: If a machine could carry on a conversation (over a teleprinter) that was indistinguishable from a conversation with a human being, then it was reasonable to say that the machine was \"thinking\".[64] This simplified version of the problem allowed Turing to argue convincingly that a \"thinking machine\" was at least plausible and the paper answered all the most common objections to the proposition.[65] The Turing Test was the first serious proposal in the philosophy of artificial intelligence.\\nArtificial neural networks[edit]\\nWalter Pitts and Warren McCulloch analyzed networks of idealized artificial neurons and showed how they might perform simple logical functions in 1943. They were the first to describe what later researchers would call a neural network.[66] The paper was influenced by Turing\\'s paper \\'On Computable Numbers\\' from 1936 using similar two-state boolean \\'neurons\\', but was the first to apply it to neuronal function.[60] One of the students inspired by Pitts and McCulloch was Marvin Minsky who was a 24-year-old graduate student at the time. In 1951 Minsky and Dean Edmonds built the first neural net machine, the SNARC.[67] Minsky would later become one of the most important leaders and innovators in AI.\\nCybernetic robots[edit]\\nExperimental robots such as W. Grey Walter\\'s turtles and the Johns Hopkins Beast, were built in the 1950s. These machines did not use computers, digital electronics or symbolic reasoning; they were controlled entirely by analog circuitry.[68]\\nGame AI[edit]\\nIn 1951, using the Ferranti Mark 1 machine of the University of Manchester, Christopher Strachey wrote a checkers program[69] and Dietrich Prinz wrote one for chess.[70] Arthur Samuel\\'s checkers program, the subject of his 1959 paper \"Some Studies in Machine Learning Using the Game of Checkers\", eventually achieved sufficient skill to challenge a respectable amateur.[71] Samuel\\'s program was among the first uses of what would later be called machine learning.[72] Game AI would continue to be used as a measure of progress in AI throughout its history.\\nSymbolic reasoning and the Logic Theorist[edit]\\nHerbert Simon (left) in a chess match against Allen Newell c.\\u20091958\\nMain article: Logic theorist\\nWhen access to digital computers became possible in the mid-fifties, a few scientists instinctively recognized that a machine that could manipulate numbers could also manipulate symbols and that the manipulation of symbols could well be the essence of human thought. This was a new approach to creating thinking machines.[73][74]\\nIn 1955, Allen Newell and future Nobel Laureate Herbert A. Simon created the \"Logic Theorist\", with help from J. C. Shaw. The program would eventually prove 38 of the first 52 theorems in Russell and Whitehead\\'s Principia Mathematica, and find new and more elegant proofs for some.[75] Simon said that they had \"solved the venerable mind/body problem, explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of mind.\"[76][c] The symbolic reasoning paradigm they introduced would dominate AI research and funding until the middle 90s, as well as inspire the cognitive revolution.\\nDartmouth Workshop[edit]\\nMain article: Dartmouth workshop\\nThe Dartmouth workshop of 1956 was a pivotal event that marked the formal inception of AI as an academic discipline.[61] It was organized by Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy, with the support of two senior scientists Claude Shannon and Nathan Rochester of IBM. The proposal for the conference stated they intended to test the assertion that \"every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\".[77][d] The term \"Artificial Intelligence\" was introduced by John McCarthy at the workshop.[e] The participants included Ray Solomonoff, Oliver Selfridge, Trenchard More, Arthur Samuel, Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon, all of whom would create important programs during the first decades of AI research.[83][f] At the workshop Newell and Simon debuted the \"Logic Theorist\".[84] The workshop was the moment that AI gained its name, its mission, its first major success and its key players, and is widely considered the birth of AI.[g]\\nCognitive revolution[edit]\\nMain article: cognitive revolution\\nIn the autumn of 1956, Newell and Simon also presented the Logic Theorist at a meeting of the Special Interest Group in Information Theory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). At the same meeting, Noam Chomsky discussed his generative grammar, and George Miller described his landmark paper \"The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two\". Miller wrote \"I left the symposium with a conviction, more intuitive than rational, that experimental psychology, theoretical linguistics, and the computer simulation of cognitive processes were all pieces from a larger whole.\"[86][57]\\nThis meeting was the beginning of the \"cognitive revolution\"—an interdisciplinary paradigm shift in psychology, philosophy, computer science and neuroscience. It inspired the creation of the sub-fields of symbolic artificial intelligence, generative linguistics, cognitive science, cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience and the philosophical schools of computationalism and functionalism. All these fields used related tools to model the mind and results discovered in one field were relevant to the others.\\nThe cognitive approach allowed researchers to consider \"mental objects\" like thoughts, plans, goals, facts or memories, often analyzed using high level symbols in functional networks. These objects had been forbidden as \"unobservable\" by earlier paradigms such as behaviorism.[h] Symbolic mental objects would become the major focus of AI research and funding for the next several decades.\\nEarly successes (1956-1974)[edit]\\nThe programs developed in the years after the Dartmouth Workshop were, to most people, simply \"astonishing\":[i] computers were solving algebra word problems, proving theorems in geometry and learning to speak English. Few at the time would have believed that such \"intelligent\" behavior by machines was possible at all.[90][91][89] Researchers expressed an intense optimism in private and in print, predicting that a fully intelligent machine would be built in less than 20 years.[92] Government agencies like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA, then known as \"ARPA\") poured money into the field.[93] Artificial Intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and US universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.[60]\\nApproaches[edit]\\nThere were many successful programs and new directions in the late 50s and 1960s. Among the most influential were these:\\nReasoning, planning and problem solving as search[edit]\\nMany early AI programs used the same basic algorithm. To achieve some goal (like winning a game or proving a theorem), they proceeded step by step towards it (by making a move or a deduction) as if searching through a maze, backtracking whenever they reached a dead end.[94] The principal difficulty was that, for many problems, the number of possible paths through the \"maze\" was astronomical (a situation known as a \"combinatorial explosion\"). Researchers would reduce the search space by using heuristics that would eliminate paths that were unlikely to lead to a solution.[95]\\nNewell and Simon tried to capture a general version of this algorithm in a program called the \"General Problem Solver\".[96][97] Other \"searching\" programs were able to accomplish impressive tasks like solving problems in geometry and algebra, such as Herbert Gelernter\\'s Geometry Theorem Prover (1958)[98] and Symbolic Automatic Integrator (SAINT), written by Minsky\\'s student James Slagle in 1961.[99][100] Other programs searched through goals and subgoals to plan actions, like the STRIPS system developed at Stanford to control the behavior of the robot Shakey.[101]\\nNatural language[edit]\\nAn example of a semantic network\\nAn important goal of AI research is to allow computers to communicate in natural languages like English. An early success was Daniel Bobrow\\'s program STUDENT, which could solve high school algebra word problems.[102]\\nA semantic net represents concepts (e.g. \"house\", \"door\") as nodes, and relations among concepts as links between the nodes (e.g. \"has-a\"). The first AI program to use a semantic net was written by Ross Quillian[103] and the most successful (and controversial) version was Roger Schank\\'s Conceptual dependency theory.[104]\\nJoseph Weizenbaum\\'s ELIZA could carry out conversations that were so realistic that users occasionally were fooled into thinking they were communicating with a human being and not a computer program (see ELIZA effect). But in fact, ELIZA simply gave a canned response or repeated back what was said to it, rephrasing its response with a few grammar rules. ELIZA was the first chatbot.[105][106]\\nMicro-worlds[edit]\\nIn the late 60s, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert of the MIT AI Laboratory proposed that AI research should focus on artificially simple situations known as micro-worlds.[j] They pointed out that in successful sciences like physics, basic principles were often best understood using simplified models like frictionless planes or perfectly rigid bodies. Much of the research focused on a \"blocks world,\" which consists of colored blocks of various shapes and sizes arrayed on a flat surface.[107]\\nThis paradigm led to innovative work in machine vision by Gerald Sussman, Adolfo Guzman, David Waltz (who invented \"constraint propagation\"), and especially Patrick Winston. At the same time, Minsky and Papert built a robot arm that could stack blocks, bringing the blocks world to life. Terry Winograd\\'s SHRDLU could communicate in ordinary English sentences about the micro-world, plan operations and execute them.[107]\\nPerceptrons and early neural networks[edit]\\nMain article: Perceptron\\nIn the 1960s funding was primarily directed towards laboratories researching symbolic AI, however several people still pursued research in neural networks.\\nThe Mark 1 Perceptron.\\nThe perceptron, a single-layer neural network was introduced in 1958 by Frank Rosenblatt[108] (who had been a schoolmate of Marvin Minsky at the Bronx High School of Science).[109] Like most AI researchers, he was optimistic about their power, predicting that a perceptron \"may eventually be able to learn, make decisions, and translate languages.\"[110] Rosenblatt was primarily funded by Office of Naval Research.[111]\\nBernard Widrow and his student Ted Hoff built ADALINE (1960) and MADALINE (1962), which had up to 1000 adjustable weights.[112][113] A group at Stanford Research Institute led by Charles A. Rosen and Alfred E. (Ted) Brain built two neural network machines named MINOS I (1960) and II (1963), mainly funded by U.S. Army Signal Corps. MINOS II[114] had 6600 adjustable weights,[115] and was controlled with an SDS 910 computer in a configuration named MINOS III (1968), which could classify symbols on army maps, and recognize hand-printed characters on Fortran coding sheets.[116][117] Most of neural network research during this early period involved building and using bespoke hardware, rather than simulation on digital computers.[k]\\nHowever, partly due to lack of results and partly due to competition from symbolic AI research, the MINOS project ran out of funding in 1966. Rosenblatt failed to secure continued funding in the 1960s.[118] In 1969, research came to a sudden halt with the publication of Minsky and Papert\\'s 1969 book Perceptrons.[119] It suggested that there were severe limitations to what perceptrons could do and that Rosenblatt\\'s predictions had been grossly exaggerated. The effect of the book was that virtually no research was funded in connectionism for 10 years.[120] The competition for government funding ended with the victory of symbolic AI approaches over neural networks.[117][118]\\nMinsky (who had worked on SNARC) became a staunch objector to pure connectionist AI. Widrow (who had worked on ADALINE) turned to adaptive signal processing. The SRI group (which worked on MINOS) turned to symbolic AI and robotics.[117][118]\\nThe main problem was the inability to train multilayered networks (versions of backpropagation had already been used in other fields but it was unknown to these researchers).[121][120] The AI community became aware of backpropogation in the 80s,[122] and, in the 21st century, neural networks would become enormously successful, fulfilling all of Rosenblatt\\'s optimistic predictions. Rosenblatt did not live to see this, however, as he died in a boating accident in 1971.[123]\\nOptimism[edit]\\nThe first generation of AI researchers made these predictions about their work:\\n1958, H. A. Simon and Allen Newell: \"within ten years a digital computer will be the world\\'s chess champion\" and \"within ten years a digital computer will discover and prove an important new mathematical theorem.\"[124]\\n1965, H. A. Simon: \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do.\"[125]\\n1967, Marvin Minsky: \"Within a generation... the problem of creating \\'artificial intelligence\\' will substantially be solved.\"[126]\\n1970, Marvin Minsky (in Life magazine): \"In from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being.\"[127][l]\\nFinancing[edit]\\nIn June 1963, MIT received a $2.2 million grant from the newly created Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later known as DARPA). The money was used to fund project MAC which subsumed the \"AI Group\" founded by Minsky and McCarthy five years earlier. DARPA continued to provide $3 million each year until the 70s.[130] DARPA made similar grants to Newell and Simon\\'s program at Carnegie Mellon University and to Stanford University\\'s AI Lab, founded by John McCarthy in 1963.[131] Another important AI laboratory was established at Edinburgh University by Donald Michie in 1965.[132] These four institutions would continue to be the main centers of AI research and funding in academia for many years.[133][m]\\nThe money was given with few strings attached: J. C. R. Licklider, then the director of ARPA, believed that his organization should \"fund people, not projects!\" and allowed researchers to pursue whatever directions might interest them.[135] This created a freewheeling atmosphere at MIT that gave birth to the hacker culture,[136] but this \"hands off\" approach did not last.\\nFirst AI Winter (1974–1980)[edit]\\nIn the 1970s, AI was subject to critiques and financial setbacks. AI researchers had failed to appreciate the difficulty of the problems they faced. Their tremendous optimism had raised public expectations impossibly high, and when the promised results failed to materialize, funding targeted at AI was severely reduced.[137] The lack of success indicated the techniques being used by AI researchers at the time were insufficient to achieve their goals.[138][139]\\nThese setbacks did not affect the growth and progress of the field, however. The funding cuts only impacted a handful of major laboratories[140] and the critiques were largely ignored.[141] General public interest in the field continued to grow,[140] the number of researchers increased dramatically,[140] and new ideas were explored in logic programming, commonsense reasoning and many other areas. Historian Thomas Haigh argued in 2023 that there was no winter,[140] and AI researcher Nils Nilsson described this period as the most \"exciting\" time to work in AI.[142]\\nProblems[edit]\\nIn the early seventies, the capabilities of AI programs were limited. Even the most impressive could only handle trivial versions of the problems they were supposed to solve;[n] all the programs were, in some sense, \"toys\".[144] AI researchers had begun to run into several limits that would be only conquered decades later, and others that still stymie the field in the 2020s:\\nLimited computer power: There was not enough memory or processing speed to accomplish anything truly useful.[o] For example: Ross Quillian\\'s successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only 20 words, because that was all that would fit in memory.[146] Hans Moravec argued in 1976 that computers were still millions of times too weak to exhibit intelligence. He suggested an analogy: artificial intelligence requires computer power in the same way that aircraft require horsepower. Below a certain threshold, it\\'s impossible, but, as power increases, eventually it could become easy. \"With enough horsepower,\" he wrote, \"anything will fly\".[147][p]\\nIntractability and the combinatorial explosion: In 1972 Richard Karp (building on Stephen Cook\\'s 1971 theorem) showed there are many problems that can only be solved in exponential time. Finding optimal solutions to these problems requires extraordinary amounts of computer time, except when the problems are trivial. This limitation applied to all symbolic AI programs that used search trees and meant that many of the \"toy\" solutions used by AI would never scale to useful systems.[143][139]\\nMoravec\\'s paradox: Early AI research had been very successful at getting computers to do \"intelligent\" tasks like proving theorems, solving geometry problems and playing chess. Their success at these intelligent tasks convinced them that the problem of intelligent behavior had been largely solved.[149][150] However, they utterly failed to make progress on \"unintelligent\" tasks like recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into anything.[149][151] By the 1980s, researchers would realize that symbolic reasoning was utterly unsuited for these perceptual and sensorimotor tasks and that there were limits to this approach.[150]\\nThe breadth of commonsense knowledge: Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require enormous amounts of information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a vast amount of information with billions of atomic facts. No one in 1970 could build a database large enough and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.[152]\\nRepresenting commonsense reasoning: A number of related problems[q] appeared when researchers tried to represent commonsense reasoning using formal logic or symbols. Descriptions of very ordinary deductions tended to get longer and longer the more one worked on them, as more and more exceptions, clarifications and distinctions were required.[r] However, when people thought about ordinary concepts they did not rely on precise definitions, rather they seemed to make hundreds of imprecise assumptions, correcting them when necessary using their entire body of commonsense knowledge. Gerald Sussman observed that \"using precise language to describe essentially imprecise concepts doesn\\'t make them any more precise.\"[153]\\nDecrease in funding[edit]\\nSee also: AI winter\\nThe agencies which funded AI research, such as the British government, DARPA and the National Research Council (NRC) became frustrated with the lack of progress and eventually cut off almost all funding for undirected AI research. The pattern began in 1966 when the Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee (ALPAC) report criticized machine translation efforts. After spending $20 million, the NRC ended all support.[154] In 1973, the Lighthill report on the state of AI research in the UK criticized the failure of AI to achieve its \"grandiose objectives\" and led to the dismantling of AI research in that country.[155] (The report specifically mentioned the combinatorial explosion problem as a reason for AI\\'s failings.)[139][143][s] DARPA was deeply disappointed with researchers working on the Speech Understanding Research program at CMU and canceled an annual grant of $3 million.[157][t]\\nHans Moravec blamed the crisis on the unrealistic predictions of his colleagues. \"Many researchers were caught up in a web of increasing exaggeration.\"[158][u] However, there was another issue: since the passage of the Mansfield Amendment in 1969, DARPA had been under increasing pressure to fund \"mission-oriented direct research, rather than basic undirected research\". Funding for the creative, freewheeling exploration that had gone on in the 60s would not come from DARPA, which instead directed money at specific projects with clear objectives, such as autonomous tanks and battle management systems.[159][v]\\nThe major laboratories (MIT, Stanford, CMU and Edinburgh) had been receiving generous support from their governments, and when it was withdrawn, these were the only places that were seriously impacted by the budget cuts. The thousands of researchers outside these institutions and the many more thousands that were joining the field were unaffected.[140]\\nPhilosophical and ethical critiques[edit]\\nSee also: Philosophy of artificial intelligence\\nSeveral philosophers had strong objections to the claims being made by AI researchers. One of the earliest was John Lucas, who argued that Gödel\\'s incompleteness theorem showed that a formal system (such as a computer program) could never see the truth of certain statements, while a human being could.[161] Hubert Dreyfus ridiculed the broken promises of the 1960s and critiqued the assumptions of AI, arguing that human reasoning actually involved very little \"symbol processing\" and a great deal of embodied, instinctive, unconscious \"know how\".[w][163] John Searle\\'s Chinese Room argument, presented in 1980, attempted to show that a program could not be said to \"understand\" the symbols that it uses (a quality called \"intentionality\"). If the symbols have no meaning for the machine, Searle argued, then the machine can not be described as \"thinking\".[164]\\nThese critiques were not taken seriously by AI researchers. Problems like intractability and commonsense knowledge seemed much more immediate and serious. It was unclear what difference \"know how\" or \"intentionality\" made to an actual computer program. MIT\\'s Minsky said of Dreyfus and Searle \"they misunderstand, and should be ignored.\"[165] Dreyfus, who also taught at MIT, was given a cold shoulder: he later said that AI researchers \"dared not be seen having lunch with me.\"[166] Joseph Weizenbaum, the author of ELIZA, was also an outspoken critic of Dreyfus\\' positions, but he \"deliberately made it plain that [his AI colleagues\\' treatment of Dreyfus] was not the way to treat a human being,\"[x] and was unprofessional and childish.[168]\\nWeizenbaum began to have serious ethical doubts about AI when Kenneth Colby wrote a \"computer program which can conduct psychotherapeutic dialogue\" based on ELIZA.[169][170][y] Weizenbaum was disturbed that Colby saw a mindless program as a serious therapeutic tool. A feud began, and the situation was not helped when Colby did not credit Weizenbaum for his contribution to the program. In 1976, Weizenbaum published Computer Power and Human Reason which argued that the misuse of artificial intelligence has the potential to devalue human life.[172]\\nLogic at Stanford, CMU and Edinburgh[edit]\\nLogic was introduced into AI research as early as 1958, by John McCarthy in his Advice Taker proposal.[173][98] In 1963, J. Alan Robinson had discovered a simple method to implement deduction on computers, the resolution and unification algorithm.[98] However, straightforward implementations, like those attempted by McCarthy and his students in the late 1960s, were especially intractable: the programs required astronomical numbers of steps to prove simple theorems.[173][174] A more fruitful approach to logic was developed in the 1970s by Robert Kowalski at the University of Edinburgh, and soon this led to the collaboration with French researchers Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel\\xa0[fr] who created the successful logic programming language Prolog.[175] Prolog uses a subset of logic (Horn clauses, closely related to \"rules\" and \"production rules\") that permit tractable computation. Rules would continue to be influential, providing a foundation for Edward Feigenbaum\\'s expert systems and the continuing work by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon that would lead to Soar and their unified theories of cognition.[176]\\nCritics of the logical approach noted, as Dreyfus had, that human beings rarely used logic when they solved problems. Experiments by psychologists like Peter Wason, Eleanor Rosch, Amos Tversky, Daniel Kahneman and others provided proof.[z] McCarthy responded that what people do is irrelevant. He argued that what is really needed are machines that can solve problems—not machines that think as people do.[aa]\\nMIT\\'s \"anti-logic\" approach[edit]\\nAmong the critics of McCarthy\\'s approach were his colleagues across the country at MIT. Marvin Minsky, Seymour Papert and Roger Schank were trying to solve problems like \"story understanding\" and \"object recognition\" that required a machine to think like a person. In order to use ordinary concepts like \"chair\" or \"restaurant\" they had to make all the same illogical assumptions that people normally made. Unfortunately, imprecise concepts like these are hard to represent in logic. MIT chose instead to focus on writing programs that solved a given task without using high-level abstract definitions or general theories of cognition, and measured performance by iterative testing, rather than arguments from first principles. Schank described their \"anti-logic\" approaches as scruffy, as opposed to the neat paradigm used by McCarthy, Kowalski, Feigenbaum, Newell and Simon.[177][ab]\\nIn 1975, in a seminal paper, Minsky noted that many of his fellow researchers were using the same kind of tool: a framework that captures all our common sense assumptions about something. For example, if we use the concept of a bird, there is a constellation of facts that immediately come to mind: we might assume that it flies, eats worms and so on (none of which are true for all birds). Minsky associated these assumptions with the general category and they could be inherited by the frames for subcategories and individuals, or over-ridden as necessary. He called these structures frames. Schank used a version of frames he called \"scripts\" to successfully answer questions about short stories in English.[178] Frames would eventually be widely used in software engineering under the name object-oriented programming.\\nThe logicians rose to the challenge. Pat Hayes claimed that \"most of \\'frames\\' is just a new syntax for parts of first-order logic.\" But he noted that \"there are one or two apparently minor details which give a lot of trouble, however, especially defaults\".[179]\\nRay Reiter admitted that \"conventional logics, such as first-order logic, lack the expressive power to adequately represent the knowledge required for reasoning by default\".[180] He proposed augmenting first-order logic with a closed world assumption that a conclusion holds (by default) if its contrary cannot be shown. He showed how such an assumption corresponds to the common sense assumption made in reasoning with frames. He also showed that it has its \"procedural equivalent\" as negation as failure in Prolog. The closed world assumption, as formulated by Reiter, \"is not a first-order notion. (It is a meta notion.)\"[180] However, Keith Clark showed that negation as finite failure can be understood as reasoning implicitly with definitions in first-order logic including a unique name assumption that different terms denote different individuals.[181]\\nDuring the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, a variety of logics and extensions of first-order logic were developed both for negation as failure in logic programming and for default reasoning more generally. Collectively, these logics have become known as non-monotonic logics.\\nBoom (1980–1987)[edit]\\nIn the 1980s, a form of AI program called \"expert systems\" was adopted by corporations around the world and knowledge became the focus of mainstream AI research. Governments provided substantial funding, such as Japan\\'s fifth generation computer project and the U.S. Strategic Computing Initiative. \"Overall, the AI industry boomed from a few million dollars in 1980 to billions of dollars in 1988.\"[122]\\nExpert systems become widely used[edit]\\nAn expert system is a program that answers questions or solves problems about a specific domain of knowledge, using logical rules that are derived from the knowledge of experts.[182] The earliest examples were developed by Edward Feigenbaum and his students. Dendral, begun in 1965, identified compounds from spectrometer readings.[183][120] MYCIN, developed in 1972, diagnosed infectious blood diseases.[122] They demonstrated the feasibility of the approach.\\nExpert systems restricted themselves to a small domain of specific knowledge (thus avoiding the commonsense knowledge problem)[120] and their simple design made it relatively easy for programs to be built and then modified once they were in place. All in all, the programs proved to be useful: something that AI had not been able to achieve up to this point.[184]\\nIn 1980, an expert system called R1 was completed at CMU for the Digital Equipment Corporation. It was an enormous success: it was saving the company 40 million dollars annually by 1986.[185] Corporations around the world began to develop and deploy expert systems and by 1985 they were spending over a billion dollars on AI, most of it to in-house AI departments.[186] An industry grew up to support them, including hardware companies like Symbolics and Lisp Machines and software companies such as IntelliCorp and Aion.[187]\\nGovernment funding increases[edit]\\nIn 1981, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry set aside $850 million for the Fifth generation computer project. Their objectives were to write programs and build machines that could carry on conversations, translate languages, interpret pictures, and reason like human beings.[188] Much to the chagrin of scruffies, they initially chose Prolog as the primary computer language for the project.[189]\\nOther countries responded with new programs of their own. The UK began the £350 million Alvey project.[190] A consortium of American companies formed the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (or \"MCC\") to fund large scale projects in AI and information technology.[191][190] DARPA responded as well, founding the Strategic Computing Initiative and tripling its investment in AI between 1984 and 1988.[192][193]\\nKnowledge revolution[edit]\\nThe power of expert systems came from the expert knowledge they contained. They were part of a new direction in AI research that had been gaining ground throughout the 70s. \"AI researchers were beginning to suspect—reluctantly, for it violated the scientific canon of parsimony—that intelligence might very well be based on the ability to use large amounts of diverse knowledge in different ways,\"[194] writes Pamela McCorduck. \"[T]he great lesson from the 1970s was that intelligent behavior depended very much on dealing with knowledge, sometimes quite detailed knowledge, of a domain where a given task lay\".[195] Knowledge based systems and knowledge engineering became a major focus of AI research in the 1980s.[196] It was hoped that vast databases would solve the commonsense knowledge problem and provide the support that commonsense reasoning required.\\nIn the 1980s some researchers attempted to attack the commonsense knowledge problem directly, by creating a massive database that would contain all the mundane facts that the average person knows. Douglas Lenat, who started a database called Cyc, argued that there is no shortcut ― the only way for machines to know the meaning of human concepts is to teach them, one concept at a time, by hand.[197]\\nNew directions in the 1980s[edit]\\nAlthough symbolic knowledge representation and logical reasoning produced useful applications in the 80s and received massive amounts of funding, it was still unable to solve problems in perception, robotics, learning and common sense. A small number of scientists and engineers began to doubt that the symbolic approach would ever be sufficient for these tasks and developed other approaches, such as \"connectionism\", robotics, \"soft\" computing and reinforcement learning. Nils Nilsson called these approaches \"sub-symbolic\".\\nRevival of neural networks: \"connectionism\"[edit]\\nA Hopfield net with four nodes\\nIn 1982, physicist John Hopfield was able to prove that a form of neural network (now called a \"Hopfield net\") could learn and process information, and provably converges after enough time under any fixed condition. It was a breakthrough, as it was previously thought that nonlinear networks would, in general, evolve chaotically.[198] Around the same time, Geoffrey Hinton and David Rumelhart popularized a method for training neural networks called \"backpropagation\".[ac] These two developments helped to revive the exploration of artificial neural networks.[122][199]\\nNeural networks, along with several other similar models, received widespread attention after the 1986 publication of the Parallel Distributed Processing, a two volume collection of papers edited by Rumelhart and psychologist James McClelland. The new field was christened \"connectionism\" and there was a considerable debate between advocates of symbolic AI and the \"connectionists\".[122] Hinton called symbols the \"luminous aether of AI\" – that is, an unworkable and misleading model of intelligence.[122] This was a direct attack on the principles that inspired the cognitive revolution.\\nIn 1990, Yann LeCun at Bell Labs used convolutional neural networks to recognize handwritten digits. The system was used widely in 90s, reading zip codes and personal checks. This was the first genuinely useful application of neural networks.[200][201]\\nRobotics and embodied reason[edit]\\nMain articles: Nouvelle AI, behavior-based AI, situated AI, and embodied cognitive science\\nRodney Brooks, Hans Moravec and others argued that, in order to show real intelligence, a machine needs to have a body — it needs to perceive, move, survive and deal with the world.[202] Sensorimotor skills are essential to higher level skills such as commonsense reasoning. They can\\'t be efficiently implemented using abstract symbolic reasoning, so AI should solve the problems of perception, mobility, manipulation and survival without using symbolic representation at all. These robotics researchers advocated building intelligence \"from the bottom up\".[ad]\\nA precursor to this idea was David Marr, who had come to MIT in the late 1970s from a successful background in theoretical neuroscience to lead the group studying vision. He rejected all symbolic approaches (both McCarthy\\'s logic and Minsky\\'s frames), arguing that AI needed to understand the physical machinery of vision from the bottom up before any symbolic processing took place. (Marr\\'s work would be cut short by leukemia in 1980.)[204]\\nIn his 1990 paper \"Elephants Don\\'t Play Chess,\"[205] robotics researcher Brooks took direct aim at the physical symbol system hypothesis, arguing that symbols are not always necessary since \"the world is its own best model. It is always exactly up to date. It always has every detail there is to be known. The trick is to sense it appropriately and often enough.\"[206]\\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, many cognitive scientists also rejected the symbol processing model of the mind and argued that the body was essential for reasoning, a theory called the \"embodied mind thesis\".[207]\\nSoft computing and probabilistic reasoning[edit]\\nSoft computing uses methods that work with incomplete and imprecise information. They do not attempt to give precise, logical answers, but give results that are only \"probably\" correct. This allowed them to solve problems that precise symbolic methods could not handle. Press accounts often claimed these tools could \"think like a human\".[208][209]\\nJudea Pearl\\'s Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems: Networks of Plausible Inference, an influential 1988 book[210] brought probability and decision theory into AI.[211] Fuzzy logic, developed by Lofti Zadeh in the 60s, began to be more widely used in AI and robotics. Evolutionary computation and artificial neural networks also handle imprecise information, and are classified as \"soft\". In the 90s and early 2000s many other soft computing tools were developed and put into use, including Bayesian networks,[211] hidden Markov models,[211] information theory and stochastic modeling. These tools in turn depended on advanced mathematical techniques such as classical optimization. For a time in the 1990s and early 2000s, these soft tools were studied by a subfield of AI called \"computational intelligence\".[212]\\nReinforcement learning[edit]\\nReinforcement learning[213] gives an agent a reward every time it performs a desired action well, and may give negative rewards (or \"punishments\") when it performs poorly. It was described in the first half of the twentieth century by psychologists using animal models, such as Thorndike,[214][215] Pavlov[216] and Skinner.[217] In the 1950s, Alan Turing[215][218] and Arthur Samuel[215] foresaw the role of reinforcement learning in AI.\\nA successful and influential research program was led by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto beginning 1972. Their collaboration revolutionized the study of reinforcement learning and decision making over the four decades.[219][220] In 1988, Sutton described machine learning in terms of decision theory (i.e., the Markov decision process). This gave the subject a solid theoretical foundation and access to a large body of theoretical results developed in the field of operations research.[220]\\nAlso in 1988, Sutton and Barto developed the \"temporal difference\" (TD) learning algorithm, where the agent is rewarded only when its predictions about the future show improvement. It significantly outperformed previous algorithms.[221] TD-learning was used by Gerald Tesauro in 1992 in the program TD-Gammon, which played backgammon as well as the best human players. The program learned the game by playing against itself with zero prior knowledge.[222] In an interesting case of interdisciplinary convergence, neurologists discovered in 1997 that the dopamine reward system in brains also uses a version of the TD-learning algorithm.[223][224][225] TD learning would be become highly influential in the 21st century, used in both AlphaGo and AlphaZero.[226]\\nSecond AI winter[edit]\\nThe business community\\'s fascination with AI rose and fell in the 1980s in the classic pattern of an economic bubble. As dozens of companies failed, the perception in the business world was that the technology was not viable.[227] The damage to AI\\'s reputation would last into the 21st century. Inside the field there was little agreement on the reasons for AI\\'s failure to fulfill the dream of human level intelligence that had captured the imagination of the world in the 1960s. Together, all these factors helped to fragment AI into competing subfields focused on particular problems or approaches, sometimes even under new names that disguised the tarnished pedigree of \"artificial intelligence\".[228]\\nOver the next 20 years, AI consistently delivered working solutions to specific isolated problems. By the late 1990s, it was being used throughout the technology industry, although somewhat behind the scenes. The success was due to increasing computer power, by collaboration with other fields (such as mathematical optimization and statistics) and using the highest standards of scientific accountability. By 2000, AI had achieved some of its oldest goals. The field was both more cautious and more successful than it had ever been.\\nAI winter[edit]\\nThe term \"AI winter\" was coined by researchers who had survived the funding cuts of 1974 when they became concerned that enthusiasm for expert systems had spiraled out of control and that disappointment would certainly follow.[ae] Their fears were well founded: in the late 1980s and early 1990s, AI suffered a series of financial setbacks.[122]\\nThe first indication of a change in weather was the sudden collapse of the market for specialized AI hardware in 1987. Desktop computers from Apple and IBM had been steadily gaining speed and power and in 1987 they became more powerful than the more expensive Lisp machines made by Symbolics and others. There was no longer a good reason to buy them. An entire industry worth half a billion dollars was demolished overnight.[230]\\nEventually the earliest successful expert systems, such as XCON, proved too expensive to maintain. They were difficult to update, they could not learn, and they were \"brittle\" (i.e., they could make grotesque mistakes when given unusual inputs). Expert systems proved useful, but only in a few special contexts.[231]\\nIn the late 1980s, the Strategic Computing Initiative cut funding to AI \"deeply and brutally\". New leadership at DARPA had decided that AI was not \"the next wave\" and directed funds towards projects that seemed more likely to produce immediate results.[232]\\nBy 1991, the impressive list of goals penned in 1981 for Japan\\'s Fifth Generation Project had not been met. Indeed, some of them, like \"carry on a casual conversation\" would not be accomplished for another 40 years. As with other AI projects, expectations had run much higher than what was actually possible.[233][af]\\nOver 300 AI companies had shut down, gone bankrupt, or been acquired by the end of 1993, effectively ending the first commercial wave of AI.[235] In 1994, HP Newquist stated in The Brain Makers that \"The immediate future of artificial intelligence—in its commercial form—seems to rest in part on the continued success of neural networks.\"[235]\\nAI behind the scenes[edit]\\nIn the 1990s, algorithms originally developed by AI researchers began to appear as parts of larger systems. AI had solved a lot of very difficult problems[ag] and their solutions proved to be useful throughout the technology industry,[236][237] such as data mining, industrial robotics, logistics, speech recognition,[238] banking software,[239] medical diagnosis[239] and Google\\'s search engine.[240][241]\\nThe field of AI received little or no credit for these successes in the 1990s and early 2000s. Many of AI\\'s greatest innovations have been reduced to the status of just another item in the tool chest of computer science.[242] Nick Bostrom explains: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it\\'s not labeled AI anymore.\"[239]\\nMany researchers in AI in the 1990s deliberately called their work by other names, such as informatics, knowledge-based systems, \"cognitive systems\" or computational intelligence. In part, this may have been because they considered their field to be fundamentally different from AI, but also the new names help to procure funding.[238][243][244] In the commercial world at least, the failed promises of the AI Winter continued to haunt AI research into the 2000s, as the New York Times reported in 2005: \"Computer scientists and software engineers avoided the term artificial intelligence for fear of being viewed as wild-eyed dreamers.\"[245]\\nMathematical rigor, greater collaboration and a narrow focus[edit]\\nAI researchers began to develop and use sophisticated mathematical tools more than they ever had in the past.[246][247] Most of the new directions in AI relied heavily on mathematical models, including artificial neural networks, probabilistic reasoning, soft computing and reinforcement learning. In the 90s and 2000s, many other highly mathematical tools were adapted for AI. These tools were applied to machine learning, perception and mobility.\\nThere was a widespread realization that many of the problems that AI needed to solve were already being worked on by researchers in fields like statistics, mathematics, electrical engineering, economics or operations research. The shared mathematical language allowed both a higher level of collaboration with more established and successful fields and the achievement of results which were measurable and provable; AI had become a more rigorous \"scientific\" discipline.\\nAnother key reason for the success in the 90s was that AI researchers focussed on specific problems with verifiable solutions (an approach later derided as narrow AI). This provided useful tools in the present, rather than speculation about the future.\\nIntelligent agents[edit]\\nA new paradigm called \"intelligent agents\" became widely accepted during the 1990s.[248][249][ah] Although earlier researchers had proposed modular \"divide and conquer\" approaches to AI,[ai] the intelligent agent did not reach its modern form until Judea Pearl, Allen Newell, Leslie P. Kaelbling, and others brought concepts from decision theory and economics into the study of AI.[250] When the economist\\'s definition of a rational agent was married to computer science\\'s definition of an object or module, the intelligent agent paradigm was complete.\\nAn intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. By this definition, simple programs that solve specific problems are \"intelligent agents\", as are human beings and organizations of human beings, such as firms. The intelligent agent paradigm defines AI research as \"the study of intelligent agents\".[aj] This is a generalization of some earlier definitions of AI: it goes beyond studying human intelligence; it studies all kinds of intelligence.\\nThe paradigm gave researchers license to study isolated problems and to disagree about methods, but still retain hope that their work could be combined into an agent architecture that would be capable of general intelligence.[251]\\nMilestones and Moore\\'s law[edit]\\nOn May 11, 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov.[252] In 2005, a Stanford robot won the DARPA Grand Challenge by driving autonomously for 131 miles along an unrehearsed desert trail. Two years later, a team from CMU won the DARPA Urban Challenge by autonomously navigating 55 miles in an urban environment while responding to traffic hazards and adhering to traffic laws.[253]\\nThese successes were not due to some revolutionary new paradigm, but mostly on the tedious application of engineering skill and on the tremendous increase in the speed and capacity of computers by the 90s.[ak] In fact, Deep Blue\\'s computer was 10 million times faster than the Ferranti Mark 1 that Christopher Strachey taught to play chess in 1951.[al] This dramatic increase is measured by Moore\\'s law, which predicts that the speed and memory capacity of computers doubles every two years. The fundamental problem of \"raw computer power\" was slowly being overcome.\\nBig data, deep learning, AGI (2005–2017)[edit]\\nIn the first decades of the 21st century, access to large amounts of data (known as \"big data\"), cheaper and faster computers and advanced machine learning techniques were successfully applied to many problems throughout the economy. A turning point was the success of deep learning around 2012 which improved the performance of machine learning on many tasks, including image and video processing, text analysis, and speech recognition.[255] Investment in AI increased along with its capabilities, and by 2016, the market for AI-related products, hardware, and software reached more than $8 billion, and the New York Times reported that interest in AI had reached a \"frenzy\".[256]\\nIn 2002, Ben Goertzel and others became concerned that AI had largely abandoned its original goal of producing versatile, fully intelligent machines, and argued in favor of more direct research into artificial general intelligence. By the mid-2010s several companies and institutions had been founded to pursue Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), such as OpenAI and Google\\'s DeepMind. During the same period, new insights into superintelligence raised concerns that AI was an existential threat. The risks and unintended consequences of AI technology became an area of serious academic research after 2016.\\nBig data and big machines[edit]\\nSee also: List of datasets for machine-learning research\\nThe success of machine learning in the 2000s depended on the availability of vast amounts of training data and faster computers.[257] Russell and Norvig wrote that the \"improvement in performance obtained by increasing the size of the data set by two or three orders of magnitude outweighs any improvement that can be made by tweaking the algorithm.\"[200] Geoffrey Hinton recalled that back in the 90s, the problem was that \"our labeled datasets were thousands of times too small. [And] our computers were millions of times too slow.\"[258] This was no longer true by 2010.\\nThe most useful data in the 2000s came from curated, labeled data sets created specifically for machine learning and AI. In 2007, a group at UMass Amherst released Labeled Faces in the Wild, an annotated set of images of faces that was widely used to train and test face recognition systems for the next several decades.[259] Fei-Fei Li developed ImageNet, a database of three million images captioned by volunteers using the Amazon Mechanical Turk. Released in 2009, it was a useful body of training data and a benchmark for testing for the next generation of image processing systems.[260][200] Google released word2vec in 2013 as an open source resource. It used large amounts of data text scraped from the internet and word embedding to create a numeric vector to represent each word. Users were surprised at how well it was able to capture word meanings, for example, ordinary vector addition would give equivalences like China + River = Yangtze, London+England-France = Paris.[261] This database in particular would be essential for the development of large language models in the late 2010s.\\nThe explosive growth of the internet gave machine learning programs access to billions of pages of text and images that could be scraped. And, for specific problems, large privately held databases contained the relevant data. McKinsey Global Institute reported that \"by 2009, nearly all sectors in the US economy had at least an average of 200 terabytes of stored data\".[262] This collection of information was known in the 2000s as big data.\\nIn a Jeopardy! exhibition match in February 2011, IBM\\'s question answering system Watson defeated the two best Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[263] Watson\\'s expertise would have been impossible without the information available on the internet.[200]\\nDeep learning[edit]\\nMain article: Deep learning\\nIn 2012, AlexNet, a deep learning model,[am] developed by Alex Krizhevsky, won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, with significantly fewer errors than the second-place winner.[265][200] Krizhevsky worked with Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto.[an] This was a turning point in machine learning: over the next few years dozens of other approaches to image recognition were abandoned in favor of deep learning.[257]\\nDeep learning uses a multi-layer perceptron. Although this architecture has been known since the 60s, getting it to work requires powerful hardware and large amounts of training data.[266] Before these became available, improving performance of image processing systems required hand-crafted ad hoc features that were difficult to implement.[266] Deep learning was simpler and more general.[ao]\\nDeep learning was applied to dozens of problems over the next few years (such as speech recognition, machine translation, medical diagnosis, and game playing). In every case it showed enormous gains in performance.[257] Investment and interest in AI boomed as a result.[257]\\nThe alignment problem[edit]\\nIt became fashionable in the 2000s to begin talking about the future of AI again and several popular books considered the possibility of superintelligent machines and what they might mean for human society. Some of this was optimistic (such as Ray Kurzweil\\'s The Singularity is Near), but others warned that a sufficiently powerful AI was existential threat to humanity, such as Nick Bostrom and Eliezer Yudkowsky.[267] The topic became widely covered in the press and many leading intellectuals and politicians commented on the issue.\\nAI programs in the 21st century are defined by their goals – the specific measures that they are designed to optimize. Nick Bostrom\\'s influential 2005 book Superintelligence argued that, if one isn\\'t careful about defining these goals, the machine may cause harm to humanity in the process of achieving a goal. Stuart J. Russell used the example of an intelligent robot that kills its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning \"you can\\'t fetch the coffee if you\\'re dead\".[268] (This problem is known by the technical term \"instrumental convergence\".) The solution is to align the machine\\'s goal function with the goals of its owner and humanity in general. Thus, the problem of mitigating the risks and unintended consequences of AI became known as \"the value alignment problem\" or AI alignment.[269]\\nAt the same time, machine learning systems had begun to have disturbing unintended consequences. Cathy O\\'Neil explained how statistical algorithms had been among the causes of the 2008 economic crash,[270] Julia Angwin of ProPublica argued that the COMPAS system used by the criminal justice system exhibited racial bias under some measures,[271][ap] others showed that many machine learning systems exhibited some form of racial bias,[273] and there were many other examples of dangerous outcomes that had resulted from machine learning systems.[aq]\\nIn 2016, the election of Donald Trump and the controversy over the COMPAS system illuminated several problems with the current technological infrastructure, including misinformation, social media algorithms designed to maximize engagement, the misuse of personal data and the trustworthiness of predictive models.[274] Issues of fairness and unintended consequences became significantly more popular at AI conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The value alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.[275][ar]\\nArtificial general intelligence research[edit]\\nIn the early 2000s, several researchers became concerned that mainstream AI was too focused on \"measurable performance in specific applications\"[277] (known as \"narrow AI\") and had abandoned AI\\'s original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. An early critic was Nils Nilsson in 1995, and similar opinions were published by AI elder statesmen John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and Patrick Winston in 2007–2009. Minsky organized a symposium on \"human-level AI\" in 2004.[277] Ben Goertzel adopted the term \"artificial general intelligence\" for the new sub-field, founding a journal and holding conferences beginning in 2008.[278] The new field grew rapidly, buoyed by the continuing success of artificial neural networks and the hope that it was the key to AGI.\\nSeveral competing companies, laboratories and foundations were founded to develop AGI in the 2010s. DeepMind was founded in 2010 by three English scientists, Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman, with funding from Peter Thiel and later Elon Musk. The founders and financiers were deeply concerned about AI safety and the existential risk of AI. DeepMind\\'s founders had a personal connection with Yudkowsky and Musk was among those who was actively raising the alarm.[279] Hassabis was both worried about the dangers of AGI and optimistic about its power; he hoped they could \"solve AI, then solve everything else.\"[280] The New York Times wrote in 2023 \"At the heart of this competition is a brain-stretching paradox. The people who say they are most worried about AI are among the most determined to create it and enjoy its riches. They have justified their ambition with their strong belief that they alone can keep AI from endangering Earth.\"[279]\\nIn 2012, Geoffrey Hinton (who been leading neural network research since the 80s) was approached by Baidu, which wanted to hire him and all his students for an enormous sum. Hinton decided to hold an auction and, at a Lake Tahoe AI conference, they sold themselves to Google for a price of $44 million. Hassabis took notice and sold DeepMind to Google in 2014, on the condition that it would not accept military contracts and would be overseen by an ethics board.[279]\\nLarry Page of Google, unlike Musk and Hassabis, was an optimist about the future of AI. Musk and Paige became embroiled in an argument about the risk of AGI at Musk\\'s 2015 birthday party. They had been friends for decades but stopped speaking to each other shortly afterwards. Musk attended the one and only meeting of the DeepMind\\'s ethics board, where it became clear that Google was uninterested in mitigating the harm of AGI. Frustrated by his lack of influence he founded OpenAI in 2015, enlisting Sam Altman to run it and hiring top scientists. OpenAI began as a non-profit, \"free from the economic incentives that were driving Google and other corporations.\"[279] Musk became frustrated again and left the company in 2018. OpenAI turned to Microsoft for continued financial support and Altman and OpenAI formed a for-profit version of the company with more than $1 billion in financing.[279]\\nIn 2021, Dario Amodei and 14 other scientists left OpenAI over concerns that the company was putting profits above safety. They formed Anthropic, which soon had $6 billion in financing from Microsoft and Google.[279]\\nLarge language models, AI boom (2020–present)[edit]\\nMain article: AI boom\\nThe AI boom started with the initial development of key architectures and algorithms such as the transformer architecture in 2017, leading to the scaling and development of large language models exhibiting human-like traits of knowledge, attention and creativity. The new AI era began since 2020, with the public release of scaled large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT.[281]\\nTransformer architecture and large language models[edit]\\nMain article: Large language models\\nIn 2017, the transformer architecture was proposed by Google researchers. It exploits an attention mechanism and became widely used in large language models.[282]\\nLarge language models, based on the transformer, were developed by AGI companies: OpenAI released GPT-3 in 2020, and DeepMind released Gato in 2022. These are foundation models: they are trained on vast quantities of unlabeled data and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks.[citation needed]\\nThese models can discuss a huge number of topics and display general knowledge. The question naturally arises: are these models an example of artificial general intelligence? Bill Gates was skeptical of the new technology and the hype that surrounded AGI. However, Altman presented him with a live demo of ChatGPT4 passing an advanced biology test. Gates was convinced.[279] In 2023, Microsoft Research tested the model with a large variety of tasks, and concluded that \"it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system\".[283]\\nIn 2024, OpenAI o3, a type of advanced reasoning model developed by OpenAI was announced. On the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) benchmark developed by François Chollet in 2019, the model achieved an unofficial score of 87.5% on the semi-private test, surpassing the typical human score of 84%. The benchmark is supposed to be a necessary, but not sufficient test for AGI. Speaking of the benchmark, Chollet has said \"You’ll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible.\"[284]\\nAI boom[edit]\\nMain article: AI boom\\nInvestment in AI grew exponentially after 2020, with venture capital funding for generative AI companies increasing dramatically. Total AI investments rose from $18 billion in 2014 to $119 billion in 2021, with generative AI accounting for approximately 30% of investments by 2023.[285] According to metrics from 2017 to 2021, the United States outranked the rest of the world in terms of venture capital funding, number of startups, and AI patents granted.[286] The commercial AI scene became dominated by American Big Tech companies, whose investments in this area surpassed those from U.S.-based venture capitalists.[287] OpenAI\\'s valuation reached $86 billion by early 2024,[288] while NVIDIA\\'s market capitalization surpassed $3.3 trillion by mid-2024, making it the world\\'s largest company by market capitalization as the demand for AI-capable GPUs surged.[289]\\n15.ai, launched in March 2020[290] by an anonymous MIT researcher,[291][292] was one of the earliest examples of generative AI gaining widespread public attention during the initial stages of the AI boom.[293] The free web application demonstrated the ability to clone character voices using neural networks with minimal training data, requiring as little as 15 seconds of audio to reproduce a voice—a capability later corroborated by OpenAI in 2024.[294] The service went viral on social media platforms in early 2021,[295][296] allowing users to generate speech for characters from popular media franchises, and became particularly notable for its pioneering role in popularizing AI voice synthesis for creative content and memes.[297]\\nContemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks, and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable. This confidence must be well justified and increase with the magnitude of a system’s potential effects. OpenAI’s recent statement regarding artificial general intelligence, states that \"At some point, it may be important to get independent review before starting to train future systems, and for the most advanced efforts to agree to limit the rate of growth of compute used for creating new models.\" We agree. That point is now.\\nTherefore, we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.\\nPause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter[298]\\nAdvent of AI for public use[edit]\\nChatGPT was launched on November 30, 2022, marking a pivotal moment in artificial intelligence\\'s public adoption. Within days of its release it went viral, gaining over 100 million users in two months and becoming the fastest-growing consumer software application in history.[299] The chatbot\\'s ability to engage in human-like conversations, write code, and generate creative content captured public imagination and led to rapid adoption across various sectors including education, business, and research.[300] ChatGPT\\'s success prompted unprecedented responses from major technology companies—Google declared a \"code red\" and rapidly launched Gemini (formerly known as Google Bard), while Microsoft incorporated the technology into Bing Chat.[301]\\nThe rapid adoption of these AI technologies sparked intense debate about their implications. Notable AI researchers and industry leaders voiced both optimism and concern about the accelerating pace of development. In March 2023, over 20,000 signatories, including computer scientist Yoshua Bengio, Elon Musk, and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, signed an open letter calling for a pause in advanced AI development, citing \"profound risks to society and humanity.\"[302] However, other prominent researchers like Juergen Schmidhuber took a more optimistic view, emphasizing that the majority of AI research aims to make \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\"[303]\\nBy mid-2024, however, the financial sector began to scrutinize AI companies more closely, particularly questioning their capacity to produce a return on investment commensurate with their massive valuations. Some prominent investors raised concerns about market expectations becoming disconnected from fundamental business realities. Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of GMO LLC, warned investors to \"be quite careful\" and drew parallels to previous technology-driven market bubbles.[304] Similarly, Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital, explicitly compared the AI boom to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, suggesting that investor enthusiasm might be outpacing realistic near-term capabilities and revenue potential.[305] These concerns were amplified by the substantial market capitalizations of AI-focused companies, many of which had yet to demonstrate sustainable profitability models.\\nIn March 2024, Anthropic released the Claude 3 family of large language models, including Claude 3 Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus.[306] The models demonstrated significant improvements in capabilities across various benchmarks, with Claude 3 Opus notably outperforming leading models from OpenAI and Google.[307] In June 2024, Anthropic released Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which demonstrated improved performance compared to the larger Claude 3 Opus, particularly in areas such as coding, multistep workflows, and image analysis.[308]\\n2024 Nobel Prizes[edit]\\nIn 2024, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Nobel Prizes in recognition of groundbreaking contributions to artificial intelligence. The recipients included:\\nIn physics: John Hopfield for his work on physics-inspired Hopfield networks, and Geoffrey Hinton for foundational contributions to Boltzmann machines and deep learning.\\nIn chemistry: David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper for their advancements in protein folding predictions. See AlphaFold. [309]\\nCurrent developments[edit]\\nIn January 2025, OpenAI announced a new AI, ChatGPT-Gov, which would be specifically designed for US government agencies to use securely. [310] Open AI said that agencies could utilize ChatGPT Gov on a Microsoft Azure cloud or Azure Government cloud, \"on top of Microsoft’s Azure’s OpenAI Service.\" OpenAI\\'s announcement stated that \"Self-hosting ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance requirements, such as stringent cybersecurity frameworks (IL5, CJIS, ITAR, FedRAMP High). Additionally, we believe this infrastructure will expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.\"[310]\\nSee also[edit]\\nHistory of artificial neural networks\\nHistory of knowledge representation and reasoning\\nHistory of natural language processing\\nOutline of artificial intelligence\\nProgress in artificial intelligence\\nTimeline of artificial intelligence\\nTimeline of machine learning\\nNotes[edit]\\n^ The Lambda calculus was especially important to AI, since it was an inspiration for Lisp (the most important programming language used in 20th century AI).[46]\\n^ Alan Turing was thinking about machine intelligence at least as early as 1941, when he circulated a paper on machine intelligence which could be the earliest paper in the field of AI — although it is now lost. His 1950 paper was followed by three radio broadcasts on AI by Turing, the two lectures \\'Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory\\' and \\'Can Digital Computers Think?\\' and the panel discussion \\'Can Automatic Calculating Machines be Said to Think?\\'[60]\\n^ This was an early statement of the philosophical position John Searle would later call the \"Strong AI hypothesis\": that machines can contain minds just as human bodies do.\\n^ Daniel Crevier wrote \"[the proposal] later became known as the \\'physical symbol systems hypothesis\\'\".[78] The physical symbol system hypothesis was articulated and named by Newell and Simon in their paper on GPS.[79] It includes a more specific definition of a \"machine\" as an agent that manipulates symbols.\\n^ \"I won\\'t swear and I hadn\\'t seen it before,\" McCarthy told Pamela McCorduck in 1979.[80] However, McCarthy also stated unequivocally \"I came up with the term\" in a CNET interview.[81] The term was chosen by McCarthy to avoid associations with cybernetics and the influence of Norbert Wiener. \"[O]ne of the reasons for inventing the term \"artificial intelligence\" was to escape association with \"cybernetics\". Its concentration on analog feedback seemed misguided, and I wished to avoid having either to accept Norbert (not Robert) Wiener as a guru or having to argue with him.\".[82]\\n^ Pamela McCorduck discusses how the Dartmouth conference alumni dominated the first two decades of AI research, calling them the \"invisible college\".[83]\\n^ Daniel Crevier wrote \"the conference is generally recognized as the official birthdate of the new science.\"[85]\\n^ There were a few psychologists who avoided behaviorism and embraced a cognitive approach before it was fashionable, such as Frederic Bartlett and Kenneth Craig[87]\\n^ Russell and Norvig wrote \"it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything remotely clever.\" [88] AI founder John McCarthy called this the \"Look, Ma, no hands!\" era.[89]\\n^ This avoided the commonsense knowledge problem, discussed below.\\n^ The hardware diversity was particularly clear in the different technologies used in implementing the adjustable weights. The perceptron machines and the SNARC used potentiometers moved by electric motors. ADALINE used memistors adjusted by electroplating, though they also used simulations on an IBM 1620 computer. The MINOS machines used ferrite cores with multiple holes in them that could be individually blocked, with the degree of blockage representing the weights.[118]\\n^ Minsky strongly believes he was misquoted.[128][129]\\n^ McCorduck also notes that funding was mostly under the direction of alumni of the Dartmouth workshop of 1956.[134]\\n^ Russell and Norvig wrote \"in almost all cases, these early systems failed on more difficult tasks.\"[143]\\n^ Bruce Buchanan wrote: \"Early programs were necessarily limited in scope by the size and speed of memory\"[145]\\n^ History would prove Moravec right about applications like computer vision. Moravec estimated that simply matching the edge and motion detection capabilities of the human retina in real time would require a general-purpose computer capable of 1000 million instructions per second (MIPS). In 1976, the fastest supercomputer, the $8 million Cray-1 was only capable of 130 MIPS, and a typical desktop computer had 1 MIPS. As of 2011, practical computer vision applications require 10,000 to 1,000,000 MIPS.[148]\\n^ Such as the frame, ramification and qualification problems, as well as the difficulty of default reasoning and word-sense disambiguation.\\n^ Russell and Norvig write: \"[M]any of the concepts we name in language fail, on closer inspection, to have the logically defined necessary and sufficient conditions that early AI researchers hoped to capture in axiomatic form.\"[122]\\n^ John McCarthy wrote in response that \"the combinatorial explosion problem has been recognized in AI from the beginning\"[156]\\n^ This account is based on Crevier 1993, pp.\\xa0115–116. Other views include McCorduck 2004, pp.\\xa0306–313 and NRC 1999 under \"Success in Speech Recognition\".\\n^ Moravec explains, \"Their initial promises to DARPA had been much too optimistic. Of course, what they delivered stopped considerably short of that. But they felt they couldn\\'t in their next proposal promise less than in the first one, so they promised more.\"[158]\\n^ While the autonomous tank was a failure, the battle management system (called \"DART\") proved to be enormously successful, saving billions in the first Gulf War, repaying the investment and justifying the DARPA\\'s pragmatic policy, at least as far as DARPA was concerned.[160]\\n^ \"Know-how\" is Dreyfus\\' term. Dreyfus makes a distinction between \"knowing how\" and \"knowing that\", a modern version of Heidegger\\'s distinction of ready-to-hand and present-at-hand.[162]\\n^ Weizenbaum said: \"I became the only member of the AI community to be seen eating lunch with Dreyfus. And I deliberately made it plain that theirs was not the way to treat a human being.\"[167]\\n^ Colby and his colleagues later also developed chatterbot-like \"computer simulations of paranoid processes (PARRY)\" to \"make intelligible paranoid processes in explicit symbol processing terms.\"[171]\\n^ Wason & Shapiro (1966) showed that people do poorly on completely abstract problems, but if the problem is restated to allow the use of intuitive social intelligence, performance dramatically improves. (See Wason selection task) Kahneman, Slovic & Tversky (1982) have shown that people are terrible at elementary problems that involve uncertain reasoning. (See list of cognitive biases for several examples). Eleanor Rosch\\'s work is described in Lakoff 1987. Kahnmann published a more general theory of symbolic cognition and other kinds of thinking in his book Thinking Fast and Slow (2011)\\n^ An early example of McCarthy\\'s position was in the journal Science where he said \"This is AI, so we don\\'t care if it\\'s psychologically real\" (Kolata 1982), and he recently reiterated his position at the AI@50 conference where he said \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\" (Maker 2006).\\n^ Another aspect of the conflict was called \"the procedural/declarative distinction\" but did not prove to be influential in later AI research.\\n^ Versions of backpropagation had been developed in several fields, most directly as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation published by Seppo Linnainmaa (1970). It was applied to neural networks in the 1970s by Paul Werbos.[121]\\n^ Hans Moravec wrote: \"I am confident that this bottom-up route to artificial intelligence will one date meet the traditional top-down route more than half way, ready to provide the real world competence and the commonsense knowledge that has been so frustratingly elusive in reasoning programs. Fully intelligent machines will result when the metaphorical golden spike is driven uniting the two efforts.\"[203]\\n^ AI winter was first used as the title of a seminar on the subject for the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.[229]\\n^ McCorduck writes \"Two and a half decades later, we can see that the Japanese didn\\'t quite meet all of those ambitious goals.\"[234]\\n^ See Applications of artificial intelligence §\\xa0Computer science\\n^ Russell and Norvig wrote \"The whole-agent view is now widely accepted\" [250]\\n^ Carl Hewitt\\'s Actor model anticipated the modern definition of intelligent agents.

The model also used Geoffrey Hinton\\'s dropout technique and a rectified linear output function, both relatively new developments at the time.[264]\\n^ Several other laboratories had developed systems that, like AlexNet, used GPU chips and performed nearly as well as AlexNet,[121] but AlexNet proved to be the most influential.\\n^ See History of AI §\\xa0The problems above, where Hans Moravec predicted that raw power would eventually make AI \"easy\".\\n^ Later research showed that there was no way for system to avoid a measurable racist bias -- fixing one form of bias would necessarily introduce another.[272]\\n^ A short summary of topics would include privacy, surveillance, copyright, misinformation and deep fakes, filter bubbles and partisanship, algorithmic bias, misleading results that go undetected without algorithmic transparency, the right to an explanation, misuse of autonomous weapons and technological unemployment.

Our relationship with AI is symbiotic. Its tentacles reach into every aspect of our lives and livelihoods, from early detections and better treatments for cancer patients to new revenue streams and smoother operations for businesses of all shapes and sizes.\\nAI can be considered big data\\'s great equalizer in collecting, analyzing, democratizing and monetizing information. The deluge of data we generate daily is essential to training and improving AI systems for tasks such as automating processes more efficiently, producing more reliable predictive outcomes and providing greater network security.\\nTake a stroll along the AI timeline\\nThe introduction of AI in the 1950s very much paralleled the beginnings of the Atomic Age. Though their evolutionary paths have differed, both technologies are viewed as posing an existential threat to humanity.\\nThis article is part of\\nWhat is enterprise AI? A complete guide for businesses\\n\\nWhich also includes:\\nHow can AI drive revenue? Here are 10 approaches\\n8 jobs that AI can\\'t replace and why\\n8 AI and machine learning trends to watch in 2025\\n\\nThrough the years, artificial intelligence and the splitting of the atom have received somewhat equal treatment from Armageddon watchers. In their view, humankind is destined to destroy itself in a nuclear holocaust spawned by a robotic takeover of our planet. The anxiety surrounding generative AI (GenAI) has done little to quell their fears.\\nPerceptions about the darker side of AI aside, artificial intelligence tools and technologies since the advent of the Turing test in 1950 have made incredible strides -- despite the intermittent roller-coaster rides mainly due to funding fits and starts for AI research. Many of these breakthrough advancements have flown under the radar, visible mostly to academic, government and scientific research circles until the past decade or so, when AI was practically applied to the wants and needs of the masses. AI products such as Apple\\'s Siri and Amazon\\'s Alexa, online shopping, social media feeds and self-driving cars have forever altered the lifestyles of consumers and operations of businesses.\\nThrough the decades, some of the more notable developments include the following:\\n\\nNeural networks and the coining of the terms artificial intelligence and machine learning in the 1950s.\\nEliza, the chatbot with cognitive capabilities, and Shakey, the first mobile intelligent robot, in the 1960s.\\nAI winter followed by AI renaissance in the 1970s and 1980s.\\nSpeech and video processing in the 1990s.\\nIBM Watson, personal assistants, facial recognition, deepfakes, autonomous vehicles, GPT content and image creation, and lifelike GenAI clones in the 2000s.\\n\\n1950\\nAlan Turing published \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence,\" introducing the Turing test and opening the doors to what would be known as AI.\\n1951\\nMarvin Minsky and Dean Edmonds developed the first artificial neural network (ANN) called SNARC using 3,000 vacuum tubes to simulate a network of 40 neurons.\\n1952\\nArthur Samuel developed Samuel Checkers-Playing Program, the world\\'s first program to play games that was self-learning.\\n1956\\nJohn McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester and Claude Shannon coined the term artificial intelligence in a proposal for a workshop widely recognized as a founding event in the AI field.\\n1958\\nFrank Rosenblatt developed the perceptron, an early ANN that could learn from data and became the foundation for modern neural networks.\\nJohn McCarthy developed the programming language Lisp, which was quickly adopted by the AI industry and gained enormous popularity among developers.\\n1959\\nArthur Samuel coined the term machine learning in a seminal paper explaining that the computer could be programmed to outplay its programmer.\\nOliver Selfridge published \"Pandemonium: A Paradigm for Learning,\" a landmark contribution to machine learning that described a model that could adaptively improve itself to find patterns in events.\\n1964\\nDaniel Bobrow developed STUDENT, an early natural language processing (NLP) program designed to solve algebra word problems, while he was a doctoral candidate at MIT.\\n1965\\nEdward Feigenbaum, Bruce G.

Intuitive interfaces drove widespread adoption, even amid ongoing concerns about issues such as bias, energy consumption and job displacement.\\nGoogle\\'s rebranding of its Bard GenAI chatbot got off to a rocky start, as the newly named Gemini generated heavy criticism for producing inaccurate images of multiple historic figures, including George Washington and other Founding Fathers, as well as numerous other factual inaccuracies. Google\\'s debut of AI Overviews, which provides quick summaries of topics and links to documents for deeper research, intensified concerns over its search engine monopoly and raised additional questions among traditional and online publishers over the control of intellectual property.\\nThe European Parliament adopted the Artificial Intelligence Act with provisions to be applied over time, including codes of practice, banning AI systems that pose \"unacceptable risks\" and transparency requirements for general-purpose AI systems.\\nColorado became the first state to enact a broad-based regulation on AI usage, known as the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act, requiring developers of AI systems \"to use reasonable care to protect consumers from any known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination in the high-risk system.\" The California legislature passed several AI-related bills, defining AI and regulating the largest AI models, GenAI training data transparency, algorithmic discrimination and deepfakes in election campaigns. More than half of U.S. states have proposed or passed some form of targeted legislation citing the use of AI in political campaigns, schooling, crime data, sexual offenses and deepfakes.\\nDelphi launched GenAI clones, offering users the ability to create lifelike digital versions of themselves, ranging from likenesses of company CEOs sitting in on Zoom meetings to celebrities answering questions on YouTube.\\n2025 and beyond\\nCorporate spending on generative AI is expected to surpass $1 trillion in the coming years. Bloomberg predicts that GenAI products \"could add about $280 billion in new software revenue driven by specialized assistants, new infrastructure products and copilots that accelerate coding.\"\\nRiding the coattails of GenAI, artificial intelligence\\'s continuing technological advancements and influences are in the early innings of applications in business processes, autonomous systems, manufacturing, healthcare, financial services, marketing, customer experience, workforce environments, education, agriculture, law, IT systems and management, cybersecurity, and ground, air and space transportation.\\nBy 2026, Gartner reported, organizations that \"operationalize AI transparency, trust and security will see their AI models achieve a 50% improvement in terms of adoption, business goals and user acceptance.\" Yet Gartner analyst Rita Sallam revealed at July\\'s Data and Analytics Summit that corporate executives are \"impatient to see returns on GenAI investments … [and] organizations are struggling to prove and realize value.\" As a result, the research firm predicted that at least 30% of GenAI projects will be abandoned by the end of 2025 because of \"poor data quality, inadequate risk controls, escalating costs or unclear business value.\"\\nToday\\'s tangible developments -- some incremental, some disruptive -- are advancing AI\\'s ultimate goal of achieving artificial general intelligence. Along these lines, neuromorphic processing shows promise in mimicking human brain cells, enabling computer programs to work simultaneously instead of sequentially. Amid these and other mind-boggling advancements, issues of trust, privacy, transparency, accountability, ethics and humanity have emerged and will continue to clash and seek levels of acceptability among business and society.\\nThe current patchwork of targeted U.S. state and local legislation already proposed or enacted might well lead to a broad-based bipartisan national law that specifically regulates, or reins in, the development, deployment and application of AI.\\nEditor\\'s note: This article was updated to reflect the latest developments and trends in artificial intelligence.\\nRon Karjian is an industry editor and writer at TechTarget covering business analytics, artificial intelligence, data management, security and enterprise applications.\\nNext Steps\\nTop AI and machine learning trends\\nHow to build a winning AI strategy, explained by experts\\nAI regulation: What businesses need to know\\nSteps to achieve AI implementation in your business\\nAI conferences to attend\\nRelated Resources\\n\\nSecurity Risks to Consider with AI Integration: AI in DevOps –Replay\\nNavigating the EU AI Act –Talk\\nAI powering MDM, and MDM powering AI –Talk\\nHow IA is Actually Using AI –Replay\\n\\nDig Deeper on AI technologies\\n\\n ##### Could generative AI help to fill the skills gap in engineering?

Hermes Trismegistus would write \"they have sensus and spiritus ... by discovering the true nature of the gods, man has been able to reproduce it.\"[2]\\n10th century BC Yan Shi presented King Mu of Zhou with mechanical men which were capable of moving their bodies independently.[3]\\n384 BC–322 BC   Aristotle described the syllogism, a method of formal, mechanical thought in the Organon.[4][5][6] Aristotle also described means–ends analysis (an algorithm for planning) in Nicomachean Ethics, the same algorithm used by Newell and Simon\\'s General Problem Solver (1959).[7]\\n3rd century BC  Ctesibius invents a mechanical water clock with an alarm. This was the first example of a feedback mechanism.[citation needed]\\n1st century Hero of Alexandria created mechanical men and other automatons.[8] He produced what may have been \"the world\\'s first practical programmable machine:\"[9] an automatic theatre.\\n260 Porphyry wrote Isagogê which categorized knowledge and logic, including a drawing of what would later be called a \"semantic net\".[10]\\n~800    Jabir ibn Hayyan developed the Arabic alchemical theory of Takwin, the artificial creation of life in the laboratory, up to and including human life.[11]\\n9th Century The Banū Mūsā brothers created a programmable music automaton described in their Book of Ingenious Devices: a steam-driven flute controlled by a program represented by pins on a revolving cylinder.[12] This was \"perhaps the first machine with a stored program\".[9]\\nal-Khwarizmi wrote textbooks with precise step-by-step methods for arithmetic and algebra, used in Islam, India and Europe until the 16th century. The word \"algorithm\" is derived from his name.[13]\\n1206    Ismail al-Jazari created a programmable orchestra of mechanical human beings.[14]\\n1275    Ramon Llull, Mallorcan theologian, invents the Ars Magna, a tool for combining concepts mechanically based on an Arabic astrological tool, the Zairja. Llull described his machines as mechanical entities that could combine basic truth and facts to produce advanced knowledge. The method would be developed further by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the 17th century.[15]\\n~1500   Paracelsus claimed to have created an artificial man out of magnetism, sperm and alchemy.[16]\\n~1580   Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel of Prague is said to have invented the Golem, a clay man brought to life.[17]\\n1600-1900[edit]\\nDate    Development\\n1620    Francis Bacon developed empirical theory of knowledge and introduced inductive logic in his work Novum Organum, a play on Aristotle\\'s title Organon.[18][19][6]\\n1623    Wilhelm Schickard drew a calculating clock on a letter to Kepler. This will be the first of five unsuccessful attempts at designing a direct entry calculating clock in the 17th century (including the designs of Tito Burattini, Samuel Morland and René Grillet).[a]\\n1641    Thomas Hobbes published Leviathan and presented a mechanical, combinatorial theory of cognition. He wrote \"...for reason is nothing but reckoning\".[20][21]\\n1642    Blaise Pascal invented a mechanical calculator,[b] the first digital calculating machine.[22]\\n1647    René Descartes proposed that bodies of animals are nothing more than complex machines (but that mental phenomena are of a different \"substance\").[23]\\n1654    Blaise Pascal described how to find expected values in probability, in 1662 Antoine Arnauld published a formula to find the maximum expected value, and in 1663, Gerolamo Cardano\\'s solution to the same problems is published 116 years after it was written. The theory of probability is further developed by Jacob Bernoulli and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century.[24] Probability theory would become central to AI and machine learning from the 1990s onward.\\n1672    Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz improved the earlier machines, making the Stepped Reckoner to do multiplication and division.[25]\\n1676    Leibniz derived the chain rule.[26] The rule is used by AI to train neural networks, for example the backpropagation algorithm uses the chain rule.[9]\\n1679    Leibniz developed a universal calculus of reasoning (alphabet of human thought) by which arguments could be decided mechanically. It assigned a specific number to each and every object in the world, as a prelude to an algebraic solution to all possible problems.[27]\\n1726    Jonathan Swift published Gulliver\\'s Travels, which includes this description of the Engine, a machine on the island of Laputa: \"a Project for improving speculative Knowledge by practical and mechanical Operations\" by using this \"Contrivance\", \"the most ignorant Person at a reasonable Charge, and with a little bodily Labour, may write Books in Philosophy, Poetry, Politicks, Law, Mathematicks, and Theology, with the least Assistance from Genius or study.\"[28] The machine is a parody of Ars Magna, one of the inspirations of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\\' mechanism.\\n1738    Daniel Bernoulli introduces the concept of \"utility\", a generalization of probability, the basis of economics and decision theory, and the mathematical foundation for the way AI represents the \"goals\" of intelligent agents.[29]\\n1739    David Hume described induction, the logical method of learning generalities from examples.[6]\\n1750    Julien Offray de La Mettrie published L\\'Homme Machine, which argued that human thought is strictly mechanical.[30]\\n1763    Thomas Bayes\\'s work An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances, published two years after his death, laid the foundations of Bayes\\' theorem and used in modern AI in Bayesian networks.[24]\\n1769    Wolfgang von Kempelen built and toured with his chess-playing automaton, The Turk, which Kempelen claimed could defeat human players.[31] The Turk was later shown to be a hoax, involving a human chess player.\\n1795-1805   The simplest kind of artificial neural network is the linear network. It has been known for over two centuries as the method of least squares or linear regression. It was used as a means of finding a good rough linear fit to a set of points by Adrien-Marie Legendre (1805)[32] and Carl Friedrich Gauss (1795)[33] for the prediction of planetary movement.[9][34]\\n1800    Joseph Marie Jacquard created a programmable loom, based on earlier inventions by Basile Bouchon (1725), Jean-Baptiste Falcon (1728) and Jacques Vaucanson (1740).[35] Replaceable punched cards controlled sequences of operations in the process of manufacturing textiles. This may have been the first industrial software for commercial enterprises.[9]\\n1818    Mary Shelley published the story of Frankenstein; or the Modern Prometheus, a fictional consideration of the ethics of creating sentient beings.[36]\\n1822–1859   Charles Babbage & Ada Lovelace worked on programmable mechanical calculating machines.[37]\\n1837    The mathematician Bernard Bolzano made the first modern attempt to formalize semantics.[38]\\n1854    George Boole set out to \"investigate the fundamental laws of those operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed, to give expression to them in the symbolic language of a calculus\", inventing Boolean algebra.[39]\\n1863    Samuel Butler suggested that Darwinian evolution also applies to machines, and speculates that they will one day become conscious and eventually supplant humanity.[40]\\n20th century[edit]\\nAI history timeline image covering the most important events since 1900 to 2025.\\n1901–1950[edit]\\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

Its capacity was ten times greater than that of the T-NLG. It was introduced in May 2020,[137] and was in beta testing in June 2020.\\n2022    ChatGPT, an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI, debuts in November 2022. It is initially built on top of the GPT-3.5 large language model. While it gains considerable praise for the breadth of its knowledge base, deductive abilities, and the human-like fluidity of its natural language responses,[138][139] it also garners criticism for, among other things, its tendency to \"hallucinate\",[140][141] a phenomenon in which an AI responds with factually incorrect answers with high confidence. The release triggers widespread public discussion on artificial intelligence and its potential impact on society.[142][143]\\nA November 2022 class action lawsuit against Microsoft, GitHub and OpenAI alleges that GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered code editing tool trained on public GitHub repositories, violates the copyrights of the repositories\\' authors, noting that the tool is able to generate source code which matches its training data verbatim, without providing attribution.[144]\\n2023    By January 2023, ChatGPT has more than 100 million users, making it the fastest-growing consumer application to date.[145]\\nOn January 16, 2023, three artists, Sarah Andersen, Kelly McKernan, and Karla Ortiz, file a class-action copyright infringement lawsuit against Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt, claiming that these companies have infringed the rights of millions of artists by training AI tools on five billion images scraped from the web without the consent of the original artists.[146]\\nOn January 17, 2023, Stability AI is sued in London by Getty Images for using its images in their training data without purchasing a license.[147][148]\\nGetty files another suit against Stability AI in a US district court in Delaware on February 6, 2023. In the suit, Getty again alleges copyright infringement for the use of its images in the training of Stable Diffusion, and further argues that the model infringes Getty\\'s trademark by generating images with Getty\\'s watermark.[149]\\nOpenAI\\'s GPT-4 model is released in March 2023 and is regarded as an impressive improvement over GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains many of the same problems of the earlier iteration.[150] Unlike previous iterations, GPT-4 is multimodal, allowing image input as well as text. GPT-4 is integrated into ChatGPT as a subscriber service. OpenAI claims that in their own testing the model received a score of 1410 on the SAT (94th percentile),[151] 163 on the LSAT (88th percentile), and 298 on the Uniform Bar Exam (90th percentile).[152]\\nOn March 7, 2023, Nature Biomedical Engineering writes that \"it is no longer possible to accurately distinguish\" human-written text from text created by large language models, and that \"It is all but certain that general-purpose large language models will rapidly proliferate... It is a rather safe bet that they will change many industries over time.\"[153]\\nIn response to ChatGPT, Google releases in a limited capacity its chatbot Google Bard, based on the LaMDA and PaLM large language models, in March 2023.[154][155]\\nOn March 29, 2023, a petition of over 1,000 signatures is signed by Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and other tech leaders, calling for a 6-month halt to what the petition refers to as \"an out-of-control race\" producing AI systems that its creators can not \"understand, predict, or reliably control\".[156][157]\\nIn May 2023, Google makes an announcement regarding Bard\\'s transition from LaMDA to PaLM2, a significantly more advanced language model.[158]\\nIn the last week of May 2023, a Statement on AI Risk is signed by Geoffrey Hinton, Sam Altman, Bill Gates, and many other prominent AI researchers and tech leaders with the following succinct message: \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\"[159][160]\\nOn July 9, 2023, Sarah Silverman files a class action lawsuit against Meta and OpenAI for copyright infringement for training their large language models on millions of authors\\' copyrighted works without permission.[161]\\nIn August, 2023, the New York Times, CNN, Reuters, the Chicago Tribune, Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and other news companies block OpenAI\\'s GPTBot web crawler from accessing their content, while the New York Times also updates its terms of service to disallow the use of its content in large language models.[162]\\nOn September 13, 2023, in a serious response to growing anxiety about the dangers of AI, the US Senate holds the inaugural bipartisan \"AI Insight Forum\", bringing together senators, CEOs, civil rights leaders and other industry reps, to further familiarize senators with the nature of AI and its risks, and to discuss needed safeguards and legislation.[163] The event is organized by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY),[164] and is chaired by U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Founder and co-chair of the Senate AI Caucus.[165] Reflecting the importance of the meeting, the forum is attended by over 60 senators,[166] as well as Elon Musk (Tesla CEO), Mark Zuckerberg (Meta CEO), Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO), Sundar Pichai (Alphabet CEO), Bill Gates (Microsoft co-founder), Satya Nadella (Microsoft CEO), Jensen Huang (Nvidia CEO), Arvind Krishna (IBM CEO), Alex Karp (Palantir CEO), Charles Rivkin (chairman and CEO of the MPA), Meredith Stiehm (president of the Writers Guild of America West), Liz Shuler (AFL-CIO President), and Maya Wiley (CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights), among others.[163][164][166]\\nOn October 30, 2023, US President Biden signed the Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.[167][168]\\nIn November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks.[169] 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence.[170][171]\\nGoogle releases Gemini 1.0 Ultra.\\n2024    On February 15, 2024, Google releases Gemini 1.5 in limited beta, capable of context length up to 1 million tokens.\\nAlso, on February 15, 2024, OpenAI publicly announces Sora, a text-to-video model for generating videos up to a minute long.\\nGoogle DeepMind unveils DNA prediction software AlphaFold which helps to identify cancer and genetic diseases.\\nOn 22 February, StabilityAI announces Stable Diffusion 3, using a similar architecture to Sora.\\nOn June 10, Apple announced \"Apple Intelligence\" which incorporates ChatGPT into new iPhones and Siri.\\nOn October 9, Co-founder and CEO of Google DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs Sir Demis Hassabis, and Google DeepMind Director Dr. John Jumper were co-awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work developing AlphaFold, a groundbreaking AI system that predicts the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acid sequences.\\nSee also[edit]\\nTimeline of machine translation\\nTimeline of machine learning\\nNotes[edit]\\n^ Please see Mechanical calculator#Other calculating machines\\n^ Please see: Pascal\\'s calculator#Competing designs\\nReferences[edit]\\n^ McCorduck 2004, pp.\\xa04–5.\\n^ McCorduck 2004, p.\\xa04-5.\\n^ Needham 1986, p.\\xa053.\\n^ Richard McKeon, ed.

The history spans from ancient myths about intelligent beings to modern advancements in AI technologies. Key milestones include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Early Concepts**: The idea of artificial beings dates back to antiquity, with myths like Talos in Greek mythology and the Golem in Jewish folklore.\n",
      "2. **Foundational Work**: In the 20th century, significant contributions were made by figures like Alan Turing, who proposed the Turing Test in 1950, and John McCarthy, who coined the term \"artificial intelligence\" in 1956 during the Dartmouth Conference.\n",
      "3. **Early AI Programs**: The first AI programs, such as the checkers-playing program by Arthur Samuel and the Logic Theorist by Newell and Simon, were developed in the 1950s and 1960s.\n",
      "4. **AI Winters**: The field experienced periods of reduced funding and interest, known as \"AI winters,\" particularly in the 1970s and late 1980s, due to unmet expectations.\n",

weather forecast\\nWednesday 11 Dec - Sunday 15 Dec\\nHeadline:\\nCloudy with occasional showers. Breezy. Feeling chilly.\\nToday:\\nLargely dry and cloudy, with light showers in Kent and Sussex slowly dying away. Perhaps some brighter spells later in the north. Winds mostly light, breezy on south coast. Chilly. Maximum temperature 7\\xa0°C.\\nTonight:\\nAnother cool night.

Maximum temperature 6\\xa0°C.\\nOutlook for Friday to Sunday:\\nFriday, cloudy with patchy drizzle. Light rain arriving during Saturday, clearing later. Remaining rather chilly. Mostly dry but cloudier on Sunday, becoming warmer.\\nUpdated: 04:00 (UTC) on Wed 11 Dec 2024\\nUK long range weather forecast\\nSunday 15 Dec - Tuesday 24 Dec\\nSunday looks like being wet and windy in the north, especially western Scotland, whilst southern parts are likely to be dry, bright and breezy. All parts will be mild or very mild. Thereafter, while high pressure may try and build at times, especially in the south, the more likely scenario is for an unsettled regime to dominate. Occasional spells of rain followed by blustery showers are likely, these most frequent and perhaps wintry at times in the northwest. It may be quite windy at times too, especially towards the north. Southern areas have a greater chance of some lengthier drier spells, although even here it is still likely to be unsettled and breezy at times. Temperatures will vary around average, with oscillations between colder and milder interludes.\\nUpdated: 14:00 (UTC) on Tue 10 Dec 2024\\nWednesday 25 Dec - Wednesday 8 Jan\\nMainly unsettled conditions appear likely for most, with spells of wind and rain followed by showers affecting most areas but especially towards the northwest of the UK. Some sleet and snow is also likely at times, especially on high ground in the north. However, there are also some signs that more settled conditions are possible at times, these perhaps most likely across the south late in December or into early January. Temperatures are likely to be around or slightly above average overall, but with any more settled interludes bringing a risk of frost and fog.\\nUpdated: 15:00 (UTC) on Tue 10 Dec 2024\\nNearest forecasts\\n\\nCity of London Youth Hostel 0.6 miles\\nSouthwark 1.0 miles\\nLondon 1.8 miles\\nStepney 1.8 miles\\nIslington 1.9 miles\\nLambeth 1.9 miles\\nHorseguards Parade 2.0 miles\\nSt James's Park 2.1 miles\\nSt Pancras Youth Hostel 2.1 miles\\nThe Mall 2.1 miles\\n\\nView all locations in London & South East England\\nMore from the Met Office\\n\\nCLIMATE CHANGE ### Causes of climate change Read\\nLEARN ABOUT ### What are the different types of rain?

Gap is another favorite, offering its curation of shirts, jeans, and cardigans to its customers through the mega-retailer. While you can certainly get some loungey clothes, Gap also has elevated basics perfect for everyday wear. We’re talking ribbed knit sweaters, long puffer coats, and chic wide-leg pants. Soon-to-be-moms will love the maternity line as well.\\n\\nBest Preppy\\n\\nEnglish Factory', 'score': 0.8353838854263566, 'raw_content': \"We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.\\n\\nThe 15 Best Clothing Brands on Amazon to Affordably Restock Your Wardrobe\\n\\nThe Drop, Amazon Essentials, and more editor-loved brands.\\n\\nInStyle\\n\\nFor most, Amazon has long been a shopping go-to for everything from home products to beauty essentials, books, and groceries. More recently, however, it’s also become a destination for affordable fashion. Stylish people use the platform to shop for loungewear, workwear, and wedding guest dresses.\\n\\nFor fashion and lifestyle influencer Brittany Sansone, accessible pricing and two-day delivery on many items—thanks to the retail giant’s Prime subscription service—are big draws. “It’s easy to hop on the app and search for a trend you want to buy knowing it will arrive within hours, in some cases,” she told InStyle. And while there are indeed options in practically every category, shopping on the platform also means navigating all the brands and offerings available, which is, well, a lot. Below, you’ll find some of our very favorite labels to shop on Amazon. Many of these are exclusive to the marketplace, while others, like Levi’s, can be bought and delivered in record time.\\n\\nBest for Basics\\n\\nAmazon Essentials\\n\\nWe'd be remiss not to include Amazon Essentials. It offers all of the basics (think tanks, tees, button-up shirts, and more) in many colors and some versatile prints. Stylist Nina Vargas recommends this cute twist-front yoga top, but there are plenty of more elevated picks to choose from as well. As the name suggests, Amazon Essentials is for anyone and everyone looking to stock up on their wardrobe essentials, whether that’s sleek workout wear or a favorite white Tee.\\n\\nMost Trendy\\n\\nThe Drop\\n\\nThe Drop is an Amazon-exclusive brand that keeps its finger firmly on the pulse of what’s trending now. With a mix of beautiful basics and limited-edition, influencer-curated collections, this is the perfect place to refresh your seasonal wardrobe and score pieces you’ll return to repeatedly. It offers everything from simple to statement-making pieces. You’ll even find a great selection of shoes, bags, and accessories, all at relatively wallet-friendly prices. Nearly everything is offered up to a size 5XL, making it one of the most size-inclusive brands available.\\n\\nBest Athletic\\n\\nThe Gym People\\n\\nThe name might be a dead giveaway, but Gym People is for, well, people who go to the gym. Not just the gym, but the tennis court, yoga studio, and track, too. At Gym People, there’s an endless selection of cute sports bras, leggings (and yoga shorts), and tennis skirts—it’s really a one-stop shop for any type of fitness activity. Whatever your exercise of choice may be, you can trust that Gym People can dress you appropriately.\\n\\nBest for Knitwear and Sweater Sets\\n\\nLillusory\\n\\nLillusory is big on knitwear, namely two-piece looks. Everyone looking for cozy loungewear that feels and looks good will have a field day browsing through this retailer’s collection. From knitted cardigans to oversized turtlenecks, Lillusory sells the kind of homey attire you’d find in a Hallmark holiday movie. Rather than slouchy and unkempt, you’ll find that the pieces are cute enough to wear to brunch and even the office.\\n\\nBest for Special Occasions\\n\\nPrettygarden\\n\\nPrettygarden has affordable clothing for all occasions, but it particularly excels in wedding guest and work-friendly dresses. There are options for date night at the Opera house and modest pieces for the baby shower. More than just dresses, however, you can find blouses and pants, chic enough to wear to special occasions. Whatever momentous day you have coming up, Prettygarden is ready to bring out your most confident self.\\n\\nBest for Beachwear\\n\\nCupshe\\n\\nCupshe specializes in swimwear of all kinds, as well as related items like beach dresses, coverups, and summery jumpsuits. We’re longtime fans of the brand’s many beautiful and affordable swimsuits and want to call out its plus-size swimwear line, too. Perhaps best of all, pretty much every piece from the brand comes in many colors, so if you like something, you can snag a few variations. It’s perfect if you plan a tropical vacation, but save your shopping for the last minute.\\n\\nBest Designer\\n\\nAmazon Luxury Stores\\n\\nAmazon Luxury Stores isn’t a brand, but a storefront that gathers all the luxury, designer items on the platform in one handy place. It offers everything from Oscar de la Renta earrings to pre-loved Gucci bags and tons of sale items from brands such as Patbo, Silvia Tcherassi, and Altuzarra. Seriously, who needs Rodeo Drive, right? If sustainability and designer are your two favorite words, you’ll love the high fashion deals and the pre-loved designer deals here.\\n\\nBest Mature\\n\\nDaily Ritual\\n\\nDaily Ritual is another Amazon-exclusive brand that two of our experts cited as an amazing place to shop. Though this label is similar to Amazon Essentials, it’s even more of a back-to-basics situation, with all sorts of everyday streamlined items to have on hand as wardrobe staples. It has simple crewnecks and T-shirt dresses galore, with Vargas suggesting a scoop-neck dress as a perfect piece to throw on when you need to leave the house in a hurry. Geared more toward the mature audience, Daily Ritual has fantastic finds for those who enjoy simple yet chic looks.\\n\\nBest Sustainable\\n\\nAmazon Aware\\n\\nWhile Amazon carries basically every style of clothing you could possibly ask for, the platform definitely has a long way to go in terms of setting up sustainable standards. That’s why, if this is a major concern for you, Amazon Aware is the perfect compromise, allowing you to reap the benefits of shopping on an efficient e-commerce platform while knowing the items you’re purchasing are at least a little kinder to the planet. Every item in the Amazon Aware line features third-party certifications that ensure it meets certain standards, such as being fair trade, carbon-neutral, or using organic materials.\\n\\nBest Athleisure\\n\\nCore 10\\n\\nCore 10 is an affordable brand for activewear and athleisure, and its quality rivals Lululemon and Alo. Model Allison Weiss Brady has a soft spot for its leggings, while Vargas loves the brand's cropped hoodie. We’d be remiss not to mention that Core 10 runs up to 3X, which is more inclusive than some other brands out there.\\n\\nBest for Seasonal Basics\\n\\nAnrabess\\n\\nAre you looking for versatile basics to lounge, dance, and brunch in? Find it all here. In the summer, Anrabess boasts a curation of easy cover-ups, rompers, and two-piece sets. But with winter ahead of us, it’s all about cozy sweats and knitwear.\\n\\nBest for Loungewear\\n\\nAutomet\\n\\nWhile Automet does sell some great workout shorts, most of the selection focuses on loungewear. Think fleece-lined hoodies and sweatpants you never want to take off. “This brand gives you all of your loungewear essentials,” says fashion and beauty content creator Austen Tosone. “I've bought the sweatshorts in several colors. They're my favorite to sleep in.” That’s not to say you won’t find some great outerwear, too, like this faux leather jacket.\\n\\nBest for Jeans\\n\\nLevi’s\\n\\nLevi’s needs no introduction; the brand is known for denim clothing of all kinds—plus some cute tops to pair with said fashion, of course. Amazon is a great place to score some of the label’s best designs since they’re all organized into a handy digital storefront (and you also benefit from the quick, free shipping and free returns policies Amazon offers). Here, the jeans are broken down into categories: tapered, skinny, straight, bootcut, and loose, to make it easier to find exactly what you’re looking for. You can also shop for overalls, denim shorts, and skirts—plus this ‘70s-inspired cropped blouse. Levi’s makes many items up to a size 4X, which is rare for legacy brands. Therefore, consider it your one-stop shop for all denim and casual wear.\\n\\nBest for Everyday\\n\\nGap\\n\\nLevi’s isn’t the only legacy brand to set up shop on Amazon. Gap is another favorite, offering its curation of shirts, jeans, and cardigans to its customers through the mega-retailer. While you can certainly get some loungey clothes, Gap also has elevated basics perfect for everyday wear. We’re talking ribbed knit sweaters, long puffer coats, and chic wide-leg pants. Soon-to-be-moms will love the maternity line as well.\\n\\nBest Preppy\\n\\nEnglish Factory\\n\\nCompared to some other Amazon brands, English Factory is pricey, with styles generally ranging from $60 to $200. The brand's name should give you a pretty good idea of what to expect here, with colorful dresses that would look perfect on the English beaches of Brighton and gingham midis that were just made for a stroll around Buckingham Palace. We’re obsessed with the brand’s dresses and sweaters. If preppy chic, modest, and permanent vacation vibes are your aesthetic, you’ll find your wardrobe here.\\n\\nWhy Shop With Us\\n\\nIris Goldsztajn is a London-based writer covering fashion, beauty, wellness, and lifestyle.

October Prime Day is an exclusive period that offers limited-time price drops on thousands of products across Amazon, including the amazing beauty deals, home essentials, top-rated tech, fashion and accessories, and everything in between. Prime Day only happens twice a year, with Big Deal Days being the last installment of 2023, so it’s an ideal time to stock up on bathroom staples like t-shirt bras, TikTok-favorite beauty products, leather jackets, and Amazon leggings before fall and winter, while prices are marked down.\\n\\nHow We Selected the Best Clothing Brands on Amazon\\n\\nSince 1910, WWD — often referred to as “the fashion bible” — has been the leading industry voice of authority for senior executives in the global women’s and men’s fashion, retail and beauty communities, while also informing the consumer media that cover the market.

We paid special attention to Amazon clothing brands that cater to fall and winter 2023 trends that we’ve seen from the runways to celebrity street style.

Williams. “Amazon is all about providing access to pretty much everything, and you can get it pretty quickly.” This has much to do with the retail giant’s Prime subscription service, which offers two-day shipping on thousands of eligible items.\\n\\nWe conducted hours of research on the best clothing brands on Amazon, evaluating them on size ranges and offerings. After consulting with a lifestyle expert and considering dozens of options, we landed on these top-rated choices.\\n\\nAmazon Essentials\\n\\nSize Range: XS-6X\\n\\nThis might seem like an obvious place to start, but rest assured that the Essentials line is worthy of your attention. It offers staples that aren’t overly simple, and they’re budget-friendly. Trade your basic V-neck tee for one with a puff-sleeve detail, and fill in your edit of athletic wear with high-rise leggings and this packable puffer jacket that's 30% off. “Recently, I bought an Amazon Essentials jumpsuit for $30,” says Williams. “The quality is great, and it comes in a range of sizes, from XS to 6X.”\\n\\nAmazon Aware\\n\\nSize Range: XXS-7X\\n\\nAs a part of its commitment to sustainability, Amazon launched an eco-friendly lifestyle brand called Amazon Aware, which consists of beauty, clothing, and home goods. They’re all certified carbon neutral and meet the company’s Climate Pledge Friendly standards. (The program is vetted by organizations such as Fair for Life, Ecologo, and more.) Regarding fashion, the line offers basics such as pullover sweaters and slip dresses.\\n\\nCable Stitch\\n\\nSize Range: XS-XL\\n\\nCable Stitch offers a knitwear version of several wardrobe staples. Our favorites include this midi dress and this matching sweater set including a sweater and lounge pants. While it's a useful resource for cold-weather dressing, you can also snag transitional pieces, like a sleeveless pleated dress or a lightweight cardigan for spring and fall. Another bonus? Most items come in several colorways, so if you love a piece—you can buy multiple.\\n\\nCore 10\\n\\nSize Range: XS-3X\\n\\nAmazon partnered with Reebok to create Core 10, an affordable line of high-performance activewear. Rather than spend over $100 for a single pair of compression leggings from other brands, you can snag multiple for less than $50 each from Core 10. Another plus: The brand offers inclusive sizing up to 3X. Some of our favorites to shop are the Insulated Puffer and the Yoga Tank, which is 30% off,\\n\\nAnrabess\\n\\nSize Range: XS-XL\\n\\nIf you’re looking for quality staples that are anything but basic, you’ll want to shop at Anrabess. The brand has everything from classy cardigans to comfortable sets (hello, airport fit) to chic square-neck tops—all in modern styles you see across Instagram. You won’t find many patterns in this clothing range, but there are several color options to choose from.\\n\\nThe Drop\\n\\nSize Range: XXS-5XL\\n\\nAmazon launched The Drop to bring shoppers limited edition collections curated by top influencers—the assortments are either built from pieces they want for their wardrobe or have developed a signature look around. The concept offers fans the opportunity to copy their style muses without blowing large sums on designer pieces. The catch: Shoppers only have a chunk of time to shop the edit. There are also several staples to shop anytime that aren’t a part of the limited drops, like this blazer or sweater dress.\\n\\nFloerns\\n\\nSize Range: XS-4XL\\n\\nFloerns, a brand started in 2016 by an Italian fashion designer, has a piece for every occasion. Attending a black-tie wedding? There’s a body con maxi dress that’ll wow the crowd. Need a work-appropriate top that can also be worn on the weekends? The brand boasts a top-rated blouse that comes in multiple patterns. Planning a bachelorette? This cozy nightgown has different lingerie patterns on it. This one-stop shop even offers kid’s clothes, suits, and accessories, too.\\n\\nPrettygarden\\n\\nSize Range: S-XL\\n\\nThis clothing brand offers clothes that are elevated, floral, and feminine. (The name is Prettygarden, after all.) While their dresses are statement pieces—like elegant sweater dress and this ruched midi dress—other clothing items are available. Shop for coats, sets, or sweaters from this gorgeous range.\\n\\nCoutgo\\n\\nSize Range: 5-11\\n\\nIt can be difficult to find places to shop for shoes, but Coutgo will be your new shoe destination. From the most darling kitten heels you can transition from day to night, to these knee high boots perfect for a date, you’ll snag a new pair of shoes at an affordable price. We also love these loafers which will set you up for the fall season. Expand your shoe collection and marvel at all the choices along the way.\\n\\nMangopop\\n\\nSize Range: XS-2XL\\n\\nContouring bodysuits and tops do not have to cost an arm and a leg. Similar to the likes of Skims and Aritzia, MangoPop offers a selection of bodysuits and tops perfect for layering. Dubbed their “Second Skin” collection, these styles are lightweight and hug the body to enhance your shape. From this square neck tee to this long-sleeve bodysuit—which both come in an array of colors—the options are endless and each is made of a breathable, double-lined, and stretchy fabric.\\n\\nRent The Runway\\n\\nSize Range: Depends on the brand\\n\\nRent the Runway, the clothing rental service, has partnered with Amazon to develop an online storefront of pre-loved pieces from their archive. Shop designer brands at mega-discounts and watch your wardrobe instantly be transformed. Each piece is authenticated, so you don’t have to worry about coming across any fakes. In addition to their archived pieces, they have a design collective that allows independent and upcoming designers to create an exclusive collection, which is now available on Amazon for purchase. Shop from top designers such as Diane Von Furstenburg, Ulla Johnson, Yumi Kim, Sweet Baby Jamie, and more.\\n\\nWhat to Look for When Shopping for Clothing on Amazon\\n\\nAccording to the website, you can return eligible products within 30 days of receipt for a full refund. So long as the seller's listing is eligible for Amazon Prime, it will be subject to the same return policies as items fulfilled by\\xa0Amazon.com. Additionally, no minimum purchase is required to receive free shipping or returns.\\n\\nPrime members can enjoy a seven-day try-on for select sizes and colors, with free shipping and returns. Amazon will only charge for the items you keep.\\n\\nWhy Trust Byrdie\\n\\nHayley Prokos is a Los Angeles-based writer and editor focused on fashion and lifestyle.

With some careful planning and preparation, you can create a stylish backsplash that is long-lasting and easy to maintain. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to properly install wallpaper as a backsplash in your home.\\nChoose the Right Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nWhen selecting a wallpaper for a backsplash application, you’ll want to consider:\\n\\nMoisture resistance – Since the backsplash will be installed behind a sink or stove where it will be exposed to moisture, choose a vinyl or paper wallpaper specifically designed for high-humidity areas. Avoid regular paper wallpapers.\\nWashability – Pick a scrubbable and stain-resistant wallpaper, so it will be easy to keep clean.\\nSize of pattern – Smaller scale patterns will be easiest to work with. Large patterns can be tricky to line up.\\nSheen – Consider how the sheen (matte, satin, semi-gloss, etc.) will interact with your lighting. Glossier papers will be easier to wipe clean.\\nAdhesive – For backsplashes, always use a permanent, heavy-duty adhesive to prevent peeling or bubbling.\\nQuantity – Measure to determine how much wallpaper you will need to cover your backsplash area. Don’t forget to account for pattern matching and cutting allowance.\\n\\nPrepare the Surface\\nProper surface prep is crucial for successful wallpaper installation.\\n\\nMake sure the surface is clean, dry, smooth, and free of grease. Fill any cracks or holes with spackle.\\nSand glossy surfaces lightly to “rough up” and improve adhesion.\\nPrime walls before installing the wallpaper, especially if painting previously. Use an interior wallpaper primer or sealer.\\nFor tile backsplashes, scuff the surface with sandpaper so the adhesive adheres well. Clean thoroughly after sanding.\\n\\nPlan the Layout\\n\\nDecide on your starting point based on the pattern size and shape. It often works best to start in a less visible corner.\\nDetermine if you will need to cut any edges to fit your backsplash area cleanly. Plan ahead for straight cuts.\\nMake sure to match patterns from strip to strip. Plan the layout so seams fall between tiles or at grout lines.\\n\\nPrepare the Wallpaper\\n\\nUnroll the wallpaper and allow it to relax according to manufacturer directions, usually 10-20 minutes.\\nUsing a sharp razor blade, straightedge or wallpaper trimmer, neatly trim off the factory edges. Cut wallpaper strips to your desired length.\\nDraw plumb lines on the surface as guides for your first strip. Use a level and pencil.\\n\\nApply Adhesive\\n\\nApply an even coat of heavy-duty wallpaper adhesive directly onto the backsplash surface using a paint roller or wide brush. Don’t get adhesive on the face of the wallpaper.\\nFold book ends of the strips to keep edges clean and prevent sticking during application.\\nAllow adhesive to become tacky according to manufacturer’s directions before applying wallpaper. This is known as “open time”.\\n\\nInstall the Wallpaper\\n\\nHang your first strip, sliding it into position using a wallpaper smoother or plastic scraper. Move from the middle outwards to squeeze out air pockets. Use a level to keep the strip straight.\\nUse a razor blade to trim excess paper at ceilings, countertops or edges. Make straight cuts.\\nApply the next strip directly beside the first, being careful to match the pattern precisely at the seam. Overlap edges slightly.\\nUse a seam roller to set the seam firmly. Roll the entire strip to smooth and adhere, eliminating bubbles or wrinkles.\\nContinue applying additional strips in this same manner until the backsplash is fully covered.\\nAt corners or outlets, carefully cut the wallpaper to fit using an X-acto knife and metal ruler. Take your time here for best results.\\nWhen finished, wipe the entire surface with a clean, damp sponge to remove any adhesive residue.\\n\\nApply Wallpaper Finishing\\n\\nOnce the wallpaper is fully adhered, apply an acrylic wallpaper primer/sealer over the entire backsplash surface. This provides added protection from moisture damage.\\nUse a smoothing brush or mini roller, and apply according to the manufacturer’s directions.\\nFinally, consider applying a clear acrylic wallpaper top-coat to add a washable, water-resistant layer of protection. This is highly recommended for backsplashes.\\n\\nWith careful prep and installation, your new wallpaper backsplash will provide a beautiful focal point in your kitchen or bathroom for years to come! Be sure to properly clean and maintain it by wiping gently with a damp sponge or soft cloth. Avoid abrasive cleaners or scrubbing aggressively. Enjoy your stylish new backsplash!\\nFrequently Asked Questions About Installing a Wallpaper Backsplash\\nWhat type of wall surface works best for a wallpaper backsplash?\\nThe best surfaces for adhering wallpaper are smooth drywall, plaster, concrete, wood paneling, or primed surfaces. Avoid heavily textured or porous surfaces.\\nShould I apply primer before installing wallpaper on a backsplash?\\nPriming provides a uniform, sealed surface that will improve adhesion. Use a high-quality acrylic primer made specifically for wallpaper.\\nWhat’s the best way to measure for the amount of wallpaper I’ll need?\\nCarefully measure the backsplash area’s dimensions. Add at least 6 inches on all sides to allow for trimming. Factor in pattern matching too.\\nHow do I cut wallpaper cleanly on an uneven or textured surface?\\nUse a specialty wallpaper knife with a hooked blade. Keep the knife flat against the surface to cut precisely.\\nShould seams be vertical or horizontal on a backsplash?\\nHorizontal seams are easier to hide by lining them up with tile grout lines. Vertical seams work too. Avoid outside corners.\\nWhat if my backsplash area has an outlet that needs covering?\\nCarefully measure and cut the wallpaper with an X-acto knife around the outlet. Take your time for clean results.\\nHow soon can I use my backsplash after installing wallpaper?\\nAllow all adhesive to dry completely, usually 24-48 hours. Avoid moisture until fully cured. Gently wipe clean with a damp sponge.\\nConclusion\\nInstalling wallpaper can completely transform the look of a backsplash while adding color, texture and interest to your space. With some careful surface preparation and layout planning, the project can easily be DIYed in a weekend. Use a heavy-duty adhesive and take precautions to protect the finished wallpaper from moisture damage. The end result will a stylish, unique focal point in your kitchen or bath.

But by far, one of the most transformative wallpaper projects I’ve tackled was the backsplash in our ugly California kitchen. Wallpaper is an awesome backsplash alternative to traditional tile (especially for us renters!), but it’s also a fairly tricky installation process thanks to outlets, low-hanging cabinets, appliances, and precise patterns. Today, I’m breaking down exactly how to wallpaper a kitchen backsplash so you feel inspired (and prepared!) to tackle this challenging (but rewarding!) DIY project yourself!\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nToggle\\n\\nBefore & After\\nUsing Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nSupplies Needed\\nStep 1: Clear & Clean the Backsplash\\nStep 2: Measure Your Backsplash\\nStep 3: Plan Your Wallpaper Layout\\nStep 4: Cut the Wallpaper\\nStep 5: Apply the Wallpaper\\nDeciding Where to Stop the Wallpapered Backsplash\\nOther Renter-Friendly Kitchen Updates\\n\\nBefore & After\\nHere is our kitchen before I added a fun backsplash using peel-and-stick wallpaper. As you can see, I started with a ~ugly~ monochromatic and dark blank slate.\\n\\nAnd here is how the kitchen looked after the application of a bright white hexagon peel-and-stick wallpaper!\\n\\nThe bright white paper infused some lightness and brightness into the otherwise dreary kitchen. The hexagon design nods to a tile pattern, and the gold lines play off the cabinets just enough to make it all work nicely together.\\n\\nAlthough adding a crisp white wallpaper to this dreary space was quite the gamble, it ended up being money and time so well spent (as wallpaper almost always is!)\\n\\n\\nWhile this transformation was well worth the blood, sweat, and tears, it is definitely one of the tricker wallpapering projects I’ve done…so let me walk you through everything you need to know before you tackle something like this in your own space!\\nUsing Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nIn a “normal” kitchen, a backsplash is usually created with tile. But there might be lots of reasons you don’t want a tiled backsplash including your budget, your DIY confidence, and (as is our case) the permanence. As renters, we can’t do anything permanent to our homes, so wallpaper is an excellent alternative for adding color, pattern, and style to an otherwise bland kitchen.\\nWhy Not Use Peel-and-Stick Tile?\\nI get asked all the time why I don’t use peel-and-stick tile in our rental kitchens. And my answer is: because it’s not removable!\\nJust because something is peel-and-stick doesn’t mean it comes off easily and mess-free. In my experience, peel-and-stick tile is not a removable product and will destroy the drywall as you peel it off. If you want to add a backsplash that is removable, wallpaper (or vinyl decals like I show here) is going to be your best bet.\\nIf you REALLY want to use peel and stick tile, I came up with a clever hack to keep it renter-friendly and totally removable! See it here:\\xa0How to Install a Peel & Stick Tile Backsplash In a Rental (Without Damage!)\\n\\nWhat Type of Wallpaper Is Best for a Backsplash?\\nYou can technically wallpaper a backsplash with any wallpaper (e.g., peel-and-stick, pre-pasted, non-pasted etc). However, since this wallpaper will be in an area that gets wet, moist, and dirty, I do recommend picking a vinyl wallpaper (rather than fabric or textured) that is wipeable (most will indicate so on the packaging).\\nI personally recommending using peel-and-stick wallpaper or heavy-duty contact paper for backsplashes because they are both durable (easy to wipe clean) and removable (it just peels right off!)\\nDoes the Wallpaper Need to Be “Waterproof”?\\nIn my experience, no…at least not for a kitchen. While you may experience some splashing of water or food particles on your wallpapered backsplash, the area will rarely (if ever) get heavily saturated. As such, you will want a wallpaper you can easily wipe clean, but it does not need to be labeled “waterproof” to work well on a backsplash.\\nPicking a Wallpaper Pattern for a Backsplash\\nYou can really pick any wallpaper pattern to put on your backsplash. But if you’re hoping to mimic the look of real tile, keep an eye out for patterns that look like tile! Here are some great examples:\\n\\n1 – Black & White Herringbone | 2 – Grey & Gold Hexagon Paper | 3 – Cream & Neutral Hexagon Paper | 4 – Black Hexagon Wallpaper | 5 – White & Silver Cube Wallpaper | 6 – Blue Medallion Wallpaper | 7 – Black & White Circle Wallpaper | 8 – Grey & White Hexagon Wallpaper | 9 – Faux Brick Wallpaper | 10 – White Subway Tile Wallpaper | 11 – Black Marble Tile Wallpaper | 12 – Long Hexagon Tile Wallpaper | 13 – Marble Herringbone Wallpaper | 14 – Blue Mosaic Tile Wallpaper | 15 – Black & Gold Trellis Wallpaper | 16 – Grey & White Medallion Wallpaper\\nFrom the moment I first saw this photo on the Walls Need Love’s Instagram account, I knew the white and gold hex pattern was perfect for a wallpapered “tile” backsplash for our kitchen!\\nDetermining How Much Wallpaper You Need\\nBefore purchasing your wallpaper, it’s a good idea to accurately measure the space you are wallpapering and devise a plan for how you will use the paper.\\nWhen determining how much paper you need, be sure to take into account:\\n\\nThe surface area you want to cover\\nThe roll dimensions\\nPattern size and scale\\nPattern repeat information (usually detailed on the wallpaper’s web description or packaging)\\nWhich orientation you will hang the paper (as that can affect how much or little you need to cover certain size areas)\\n\\nIf the paper you want to use can be easily returned, considering buying extra, because not being able to finish when you run out of paper can be very…very…frustrating.\\n\\nSupplies Needed\\nEvery project will vary slightly; but in general, here are the supplies you will need to wallpaper a backsplash:\\n\\nWallpaper\\nCutting Tools\\nRotary cutter, ruler and self-healing cutting mat (although a ruler and scissors will do, these tools make it easy to get really precise cuts)\\nSharp scissors\\nSharp craft knife\\n\\n\\nPaddle Scraper – Some wallpapers come with a smoothing tool, but I prefer the wide size and shape of this one for big wallpaper projects.\\nBasic Tools\\nMeasuring tape\\nScrewdrivers for removing outlet covers\\nCalculator\\nNotebook and pencil\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 1: Clear & Clean the Backsplash\\nStart by removing any outlet covers, artwork, or other items covering your backsplash. Wipe down the blank walls of any dust, dirt, debris, grease, oil, or food particles. Let the wall(s) fully dry before applying wallpaper.\\n\\nStep 2: Measure Your Backsplash\\nWallpaper can be expensive, so I highly recommend spending a considerable amount of time planning out exactly how you will apply the paper to your backsplash (and other areas) before you even start cutting and peeling.\\nI mentioned before that wallpapering the backsplash was my trickiest papering job ever, and the picture above shows exactly why. Backsplashes tend to have lots of things that need to be papered around. Outlets are certainly one, but your backsplash might have vents, hoods, shelves, or other items that can’t be removed and need to be considered.\\nTIP! Whenever possible, remove items off the walls/cabinets instead of trying to work around them. Wallpaper is tricky enough to lay flat without anything in the way. I did everything I could to remove the under-cabinet lighting (above) but was unable to do so, which left me having to make tricky cuts around the fixtures.\\nIn order to deal with anything you need to paper around, make a detailed plan of your entire backsplash. As you can see below, I not only detailed out the length and height of each area (to the left of the stove, to the right of the stove, to the right of the window), but I also marked the exact placement of each light and outlet.\\nOn another page (not shown), I dove into even further detail, notating where precisely each light feature was so I could translate those measurements to the wallpaper during the cutting phase (more on that below).\\n\\nStep 3: Plan Your Wallpaper Layout\\nWith the dimensions fully calculated, you can then determine how best to cut your wallpaper.\\nTypically, wallpaper is hung from top to bottom and you work laterally across a space. These days, most paper is printed to be hung vertically, which will make cutting and hanging\\xa0much\\xa0easier.\\nI don’t ever do anything the easy way though. I wanted to use as little wallpaper as possible (because it’s expensive), so I chose to apply the paper horizontally (from left-to-right, rather than top-to-bottom). While this choice certainly added to the complexity of the installation, it did allow me to maximize every inch of paper with very little waste.\\nIn the notebook above (right-hand page), you’ll see I cut each wallpaper strip in half (possible because of the height of my backsplash and the horizontal installation). Instead of a 10′ length of 20″ wide paper (with lots of potential excess thanks to pattern matching), I instead had 20′ of 13″ tall strips that fit the horizontal area above the counter.\\nThis approach may not work for you based on your pattern and orientation preferences, but my point is this: think very carefully about how you can apply the pattern and how you can cut the paper to get the most space covered with as little paper as possible!\\nStep 4: Cut the Wallpaper\\nFiguring out the plan for the wallpaper may very well be your most tedious and time-consuming step. However, once you have all the measurements figured out, you just need to translate them to the wallpaper and get cutting.\\nCut Large Sections First\\nStart by cutting the large rolls down the general sizes determined in your planning. I found it easiest to do large cuts (both length-wise and width-wise) using a rotary cutter and large ruler. Before cutting a particular section, always be sure the patterns line up with the adjoining panels.\\n\\nTIP! I was trying to use up every inch of wallpaper, so I cut my panels down into the exact same measurements as my backsplash. However, if you are able to, try leaving an excess 1-3″ of paper along the top and bottom of each panel so it will perfectly reach the edges of your counters and cabinets no matter how straight (or not) you hang the paper. Then trim away the edges after the paper is on the wall.\\nPre-Cut Details\\nNOTE: If your backsplash area doesn’t have any large or unique features to work around, you can likely skip this step and set right to hanging your larger cuts of paper directly to the wall.\\nWhen papering large expanses of wall, I usually deal with outlets and other features as I’m laying the paper down. However, the backsplash area is such a tight space with so many extra features to work around, that it can be very difficult to get the paper to lie flat without pre-cutting out bulky features.\\nAfter some trial-and-error, I determined it was much easier to cut each feature (the light fixtures) out of the wallpaper before applying it to the wall. To do this, translate the size and placement of any “extra” features (precise size and location measurements are KEY!) to the larger wallpaper strips. In the photo below, you can see the faint lines of the light fixture (along the top) and the outlet (vertical line in the top/middle).\\n\\nOnce you have each feature measured and “drawn,” cut them out using a ruler and very sharp craft knife. This part can feel tedious and a bit scary (slicing big holes in the middle of your wallpaper can be a big risk!) so don’t hesitate to re-measure and double-check as much as necessary!\\n\\nStep 5: Apply the Wallpaper\\nOnce you have all the necessary features cut out of the wallpaper strip, it’s time to apply it! As I mentioned above, I chose to hang my temporary wallpaper horizontally to conserve paper and eliminate excessive match lines on such a small area.\\nNo matter how you are applying your paper (top-to-bottom or side-to-side), peel off just a few inches of the paper backing from the top/side of the wallpaper. Stick that leading edge to the wall, ensuring it is as straight as possible. Then as you work across/down the wall, slowly peel away the paper backing and smooth the paper down with a large paddle scraper.\\n\\nAs you get to edges, outlets, and corners, use a sharp craft knife to make notches as necessary (to relieve paper tension) or trim away extra paper. Once you get the paper in place, use the scraper to really adhere the paper to the wall and work out any wrinkles or bubbles.\\n\\nContinuing hanging your panels, matching up the patterns and working around features, until your entire backsplash area is covered in removable wallpaper!\\nWorking Around Outlets\\nBefore hanging the wallpaper on the wall, I recommend creating a single vertical slit for each outlet (to relieve the paper tension and allow the paper to lay flat on the surrounding wall). Once the paper is fully adhered to the wall, re-visit the outlets to trim away extra paper and ensure it’s laying smooth and flat in every direction. Replace outlet covers only once you’re satisfied with the placement and smoothness of the wallpaper.\\n\\nMore Application Tips & Tricks\\nMy pictures and descriptions make it sound like you just lay the paper down, replace your outlet covers, and walk away. In truth, it will require a lot of placing, peeling off and re-placing; tugging and pulling; sweating; and maybe even crying. Working with peel-and-stick paper CAN be very exasperating, so here are some things to keep in mind:\\n\\nDon’t hesitate to pull it off and re-lay it down. Whether it’s your initial 2″ or the full sheet, if it’s angled funny or has lots of wrinkles you can’t easily get out with a scraper, simply peel the sheet off and re-stick it. I promise, it will stick again.\\nDon’t force it. If your initial 2″ of paper aren’t quite level, the paper will only continue to “veer off course” as you move down/across the wall. It’s better to peel it off and re-align the panel instead of trying to re-route the paper further down the wall.\\nCorners. I chose to cut long strips of paper that would stretch into and past the corners so that the pattern would continue nicely. However, getting paper to “turn the corner” straight can be very difficult. In hindsight, I would have sliced the paper at each corner and started a fresh application at each turn.\\nThe paper is REALLY durable. Don’t hesitate to bend, wrinkle, or curl up the paper as you’re working with it. It’s veeeery durable and once you have it smoothed onto your wall, those bends and wrinkles won’t even be noticeable.\\nTake a step back. Despite my efforts for the smoothest application possible, I was still left with some pretty considerable wrinkles in the paper (those darn corners!). But that’s actually one of the best things about wallpaper. It’s so “big picture,” and those small imperfections aren’t really noticeable in day-to-day life. So do the best you can, step away, and just enjoy the improved view!\\n\\nDeciding Where to Stop the Wallpapered Backsplash\\nOne of the trickiest things about backsplashes (tiled, painted, papered, anything!) is deciding where to stop. In some kitchens, there will be doors, trim, appliances, molding, or ends of counter top that make it very clear where the wallpaper installation should end. Other times, it’s not as evident.\\nMy original plan was to only tile the backsplash, and I used the width of our countertop and the height of the cabinets as my guide (as seen below).\\n\\nBut even as I stepped back, put my supplies away, and called the job done, the “tiling” really bothered me. The white paper felt random in the context of the rest of the kitchen; and instead of my eye drifting to the pretty paper, it kept drifting to the ceiling where there was none. Below is a quick snapshot I took as I debated (for weeks!) what to do about it.\\n\\nI finally decided that I needed to extend the wallpaper up the wall to the ceiling in order to make it work. After a quick calculation, I determined I had enough paper leftover to cover the remaining wall (I originally bought enough to “tile” the fireplace in the adjoining family room too).\\n\\nThe wonderful thing about installing wallpaper above cabinets is that there is usually nothing to work around…no outlets, no lights! As such, I just cut the paper into strips and put it right up, matching the pattern as I went around the kitchen.\\n\\nWe lived with just the backsplash area done for about 2 months before I finally did the rest of the wall, and to say the change was dramatic is an understatement. The wallpapered backsplash went from feeling random and disjointed to providing a fun and fresh detail that really woke up the entire kitchen.\\nIf your cabinets do not reach the ceiling or a soffit, I highly recommend wallpapering the area above the cabinets for the most visual impact.\\n\\n\\nIn the three years we lived in this house, I was never\\xa0really able to get used to the brown cabinets and brown counters and brown floors. But the small temporary changes I was able to make (like the wallpapered backsplash and this simple window valance) truly helped me like the space a lot more than the dull cave we started with. Although this wallpaper backsplash wasn’t the easiest DIY I’ve taken on, it was certainly one of the most rewarding!\\n\\nOther Renter-Friendly Kitchen Updates\\n\\nHow to Shiplap a Kitchen Island with Command Strips\\nA DIY Butcher Block Island Countertop (Anyone Can Do!)\\nAn Easy Way to Add Pattern to Your Pantry with Wrapping Paper\\n\\nWhether you rent or own, I suspect most of us have aspects of our homes we just don’t love.

It makes such a difference. Here’s another suggestion for you. Chalkboard vinyl on the panels of your cabinet doors. My son-in-law suggested that I paint my doors with the chalkboard paint, but I couldn’t bring myself to do something so permanent. I found the vinyl online though, on some sort of deal, and I LOVE IT. It is fun to label my cabinets, and it would cut way back on the brown in your kitchen. (I think it would coordinate with the black on your fridge and appliances, too.) Anyway, just a suggestion.

Most peel-and-stick papers are like a thick contact paper, so they can easily be wiped clean.

And we have lived in North Carolina, Kansas, California and Virginia. That said, I would ALWAYS do a test on any wall and leave it up for a while before you do a full installation.\\nThird, most peel-and-stick wallpapers are wipeable/washable. So if the wallpaper DOES stay up, you’d be able to clean it without any issue. The white wallpaper in this post was wiped down with a wet rag constantly.\\nFinally, if you determine you do need something over the wallpaper, some sort of plexiglass/acrylic sheet could work (although it would be pricey) or you could try clear contact paper.\\xa0\\nHope those thoughts help a bit!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDS53 — October 12, 2020 @ 9:46 pm Reply\\nYou are so very inspiring!\\n\\n\\nthehomesihavemade — October 16, 2020 @ 8:51 am Reply\\nThanks so much…glad you stopped by!\\nMegan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShonda — April 14, 2022 @ 10:58 am Reply\\nAny thoughts on how you would manage an outside corner with wallpaper?\\n\\n\\nMegan — April 14, 2022 @ 12:03 pm Reply\\nHi Shonda!\\nI’m not sure what you mean by outside corner…do you mean one that protrudes outward rather than in?\\nI actually think paper bends easier around a protruding\\xa0corner, but it will still be tricky to keep it perfectly level. I’d give it a try going around the corner first. If you can’t get the follow-on paper to line up level, then you could technically cut it at the corner and start over, but you run the risk of the seam being really visible.\\xa0\\nIf you cut your paper 1-2″ taller than you need, you’d be able to turn the corner and not have any gap between the paper and the upper cabinets, even if it does go a little off as you make the bend.\\nDoes that help?\\nThanks!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContent Sidebar\\n\\nHi, I'm Megan!\\nI am a military spouse, mom to 3 young boys, and a constant creator.

The hexagon design nods to a tile pattern, and the gold lines play off the cabinets just enough to make it all work nicely together.\\n\\nAlthough adding a crisp white wallpaper to this dreary space was quite the gamble, it ended up being money and time so well spent (as wallpaper almost always is!)\\n\\n\\nWhile this transformation was well worth the blood, sweat, and tears, it is definitely one of the tricker wallpapering projects I’ve done…so let me walk you through everything you need to know before you tackle something like this in your own space!\\nUsing Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nIn a “normal” kitchen, a backsplash is usually created with tile. But there might be lots of reasons you don’t want a tiled backsplash including your budget, your DIY confidence, and (as is our case) the permanence. As renters, we can’t do anything permanent to our homes, so wallpaper is an excellent alternative for adding color, pattern, and style to an otherwise bland kitchen.\\nWhy Not Use Peel-and-Stick Tile?\\nI get asked all the time why I don’t use peel-and-stick tile in our rental kitchens. And my answer is: because it’s not removable!\\nJust because something is peel-and-stick doesn’t mean it comes off easily and mess-free. In my experience, peel-and-stick tile is not a removable product and will destroy the drywall as you peel it off. If you want to add a backsplash that is removable, wallpaper (or vinyl decals like I show here) is going to be your best bet.\\nIf you REALLY want to use peel and stick tile, I came up with a clever hack to keep it renter-friendly and totally removable! See it here:\\xa0How to Install a Peel & Stick Tile Backsplash In a Rental (Without Damage!)\\n\\nWhat Type of Wallpaper Is Best for a Backsplash?\\nYou can technically wallpaper a backsplash with any wallpaper (e.g., peel-and-stick, pre-pasted, non-pasted etc). However, since this wallpaper will be in an area that gets wet, moist, and dirty, I do recommend picking a vinyl wallpaper (rather than fabric or textured) that is wipeable (most will indicate so on the packaging).\\nI personally recommending using peel-and-stick wallpaper or heavy-duty contact paper for backsplashes because they are both durable (easy to wipe clean) and removable (it just peels right off!)\\nDoes the Wallpaper Need to Be “Waterproof”?\\nIn my experience, no…at least not for a kitchen. While you may experience some splashing of water or food particles on your wallpapered backsplash, the area will rarely (if ever) get heavily saturated. As such, you will want a wallpaper you can easily wipe clean, but it does not need to be labeled “waterproof” to work well on a backsplash.\\nPicking a Wallpaper Pattern for a Backsplash\\nYou can really pick any wallpaper pattern to put on your backsplash. But if you’re hoping to mimic the look of real tile, keep an eye out for patterns that look like tile! Here are some great examples:\\n\\n1 – Black & White Herringbone | 2 – Grey & Gold Hexagon Paper | 3 – Cream & Neutral Hexagon Paper | 4 – Black Hexagon Wallpaper | 5 – White & Silver Cube Wallpaper | 6 – Blue Medallion Wallpaper | 7 – Black & White Circle Wallpaper | 8 – Grey & White Hexagon Wallpaper | 9 – Faux Brick Wallpaper | 10 – White Subway Tile Wallpaper | 11 – Black Marble Tile Wallpaper | 12 – Long Hexagon Tile Wallpaper | 13 – Marble Herringbone Wallpaper | 14 – Blue Mosaic Tile Wallpaper | 15 – Black & Gold Trellis Wallpaper | 16 – Grey & White Medallion Wallpaper\\nFrom the moment I first saw this photo on the Walls Need Love’s Instagram account, I knew the white and gold hex pattern was perfect for a wallpapered “tile” backsplash for our kitchen!\\nDetermining How Much Wallpaper You Need\\nBefore purchasing your wallpaper, it’s a good idea to accurately measure the space you are wallpapering and devise a plan for how you will use the paper.\\nWhen determining how much paper you need, be sure to take into account:\\n\\nThe surface area you want to cover\\nThe roll dimensions\\nPattern size and scale\\nPattern repeat information (usually detailed on the wallpaper’s web description or packaging)\\nWhich orientation you will hang the paper (as that can affect how much or little you need to cover certain size areas)\\n\\nIf the paper you want to use can be easily returned, considering buying extra, because not being able to finish when you run out of paper can be very…very…frustrating.\\n\\nSupplies Needed\\nEvery project will vary slightly; but in general, here are the supplies you will need to wallpaper a backsplash:\\n\\nWallpaper\\nCutting Tools\\nRotary cutter, ruler and self-healing cutting mat (although a ruler and scissors will do, these tools make it easy to get really precise cuts)\\nSharp scissors\\nSharp craft knife\\n\\n\\nPaddle Scraper – Some wallpapers come with a smoothing tool, but I prefer the wide size and shape of this one for big wallpaper projects.\\nBasic Tools\\nMeasuring tape\\nScrewdrivers for removing outlet covers\\nCalculator\\nNotebook and pencil\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 1: Clear & Clean the Backsplash\\nStart by removing any outlet covers, artwork, or other items covering your backsplash. Wipe down the blank walls of any dust, dirt, debris, grease, oil, or food particles. Let the wall(s) fully dry before applying wallpaper.\\n\\nStep 2: Measure Your Backsplash\\nWallpaper can be expensive, so I highly recommend spending a considerable amount of time planning out exactly how you will apply the paper to your backsplash (and other areas) before you even start cutting and peeling.\\nI mentioned before that wallpapering the backsplash was my trickiest papering job ever, and the picture above shows exactly why. Backsplashes tend to have lots of things that need to be papered around. Outlets are certainly one, but your backsplash might have vents, hoods, shelves, or other items that can’t be removed and need to be considered.\\nTIP! Whenever possible, remove items off the walls/cabinets instead of trying to work around them. Wallpaper is tricky enough to lay flat without anything in the way. I did everything I could to remove the under-cabinet lighting (above) but was unable to do so, which left me having to make tricky cuts around the fixtures.\\nIn order to deal with anything you need to paper around, make a detailed plan of your entire backsplash. As you can see below, I not only detailed out the length and height of each area (to the left of the stove, to the right of the stove, to the right of the window), but I also marked the exact placement of each light and outlet.\\nOn another page (not shown), I dove into even further detail, notating where precisely each light feature was so I could translate those measurements to the wallpaper during the cutting phase (more on that below).\\n\\nStep 3: Plan Your Wallpaper Layout\\nWith the dimensions fully calculated, you can then determine how best to cut your wallpaper.\\nTypically, wallpaper is hung from top to bottom and you work laterally across a space. These days, most paper is printed to be hung vertically, which will make cutting and hanging\\xa0much\\xa0easier.\\nI don’t ever do anything the easy way though. I wanted to use as little wallpaper as possible (because it’s expensive), so I chose to apply the paper horizontally (from left-to-right, rather than top-to-bottom). While this choice certainly added to the complexity of the installation, it did allow me to maximize every inch of paper with very little waste.\\nIn the notebook above (right-hand page), you’ll see I cut each wallpaper strip in half (possible because of the height of my backsplash and the horizontal installation). Instead of a 10′ length of 20″ wide paper (with lots of potential excess thanks to pattern matching), I instead had 20′ of 13″ tall strips that fit the horizontal area above the counter.\\nThis approach may not work for you based on your pattern and orientation preferences, but my point is this: think very carefully about how you can apply the pattern and how you can cut the paper to get the most space covered with as little paper as possible!\\nStep 4: Cut the Wallpaper\\nFiguring out the plan for the wallpaper may very well be your most tedious and time-consuming step. However, once you have all the measurements figured out, you just need to translate them to the wallpaper and get cutting.\\nCut Large Sections First\\nStart by cutting the large rolls down the general sizes determined in your planning. I found it easiest to do large cuts (both length-wise and width-wise) using a rotary cutter and large ruler. Before cutting a particular section, always be sure the patterns line up with the adjoining panels.\\n\\nTIP! I was trying to use up every inch of wallpaper, so I cut my panels down into the exact same measurements as my backsplash. However, if you are able to, try leaving an excess 1-3″ of paper along the top and bottom of each panel so it will perfectly reach the edges of your counters and cabinets no matter how straight (or not) you hang the paper. Then trim away the edges after the paper is on the wall.\\nPre-Cut Details\\nNOTE: If your backsplash area doesn’t have any large or unique features to work around, you can likely skip this step and set right to hanging your larger cuts of paper directly to the wall.\\nWhen papering large expanses of wall, I usually deal with outlets and other features as I’m laying the paper down. However, the backsplash area is such a tight space with so many extra features to work around, that it can be very difficult to get the paper to lie flat without pre-cutting out bulky features.\\nAfter some trial-and-error, I determined it was much easier to cut each feature (the light fixtures) out of the wallpaper before applying it to the wall. To do this, translate the size and placement of any “extra” features (precise size and location measurements are KEY!) to the larger wallpaper strips. In the photo below, you can see the faint lines of the light fixture (along the top) and the outlet (vertical line in the top/middle).\\n\\nOnce you have each feature measured and “drawn,” cut them out using a ruler and very sharp craft knife. This part can feel tedious and a bit scary (slicing big holes in the middle of your wallpaper can be a big risk!) so don’t hesitate to re-measure and double-check as much as necessary!\\n\\nStep 5: Apply the Wallpaper\\nOnce you have all the necessary features cut out of the wallpaper strip, it’s time to apply it! As I mentioned above, I chose to hang my temporary wallpaper horizontally to conserve paper and eliminate excessive match lines on such a small area.\\nNo matter how you are applying your paper (top-to-bottom or side-to-side), peel off just a few inches of the paper backing from the top/side of the wallpaper. Stick that leading edge to the wall, ensuring it is as straight as possible. Then as you work across/down the wall, slowly peel away the paper backing and smooth the paper down with a large paddle scraper.\\n\\nAs you get to edges, outlets, and corners, use a sharp craft knife to make notches as necessary (to relieve paper tension) or trim away extra paper. Once you get the paper in place, use the scraper to really adhere the paper to the wall and work out any wrinkles or bubbles.\\n\\nContinuing hanging your panels, matching up the patterns and working around features, until your entire backsplash area is covered in removable wallpaper!\\nWorking Around Outlets\\nBefore hanging the wallpaper on the wall, I recommend creating a single vertical slit for each outlet (to relieve the paper tension and allow the paper to lay flat on the surrounding wall). Once the paper is fully adhered to the wall, re-visit the outlets to trim away extra paper and ensure it’s laying smooth and flat in every direction. Replace outlet covers only once you’re satisfied with the placement and smoothness of the wallpaper.\\n\\nMore Application Tips & Tricks\\nMy pictures and descriptions make it sound like you just lay the paper down, replace your outlet covers, and walk away. In truth, it will require a lot of placing, peeling off and re-placing; tugging and pulling; sweating; and maybe even crying. Working with peel-and-stick paper CAN be very exasperating, so here are some things to keep in mind:\\n\\nDon’t hesitate to pull it off and re-lay it down. Whether it’s your initial 2″ or the full sheet, if it’s angled funny or has lots of wrinkles you can’t easily get out with a scraper, simply peel the sheet off and re-stick it. I promise, it will stick again.\\nDon’t force it. If your initial 2″ of paper aren’t quite level, the paper will only continue to “veer off course” as you move down/across the wall. It’s better to peel it off and re-align the panel instead of trying to re-route the paper further down the wall.\\nCorners. I chose to cut long strips of paper that would stretch into and past the corners so that the pattern would continue nicely. However, getting paper to “turn the corner” straight can be very difficult. In hindsight, I would have sliced the paper at each corner and started a fresh application at each turn.\\nThe paper is REALLY durable. Don’t hesitate to bend, wrinkle, or curl up the paper as you’re working with it. It’s veeeery durable and once you have it smoothed onto your wall, those bends and wrinkles won’t even be noticeable.\\nTake a step back. Despite my efforts for the smoothest application possible, I was still left with some pretty considerable wrinkles in the paper (those darn corners!). But that’s actually one of the best things about wallpaper. It’s so “big picture,” and those small imperfections aren’t really noticeable in day-to-day life. So do the best you can, step away, and just enjoy the improved view!\\n\\nDeciding Where to Stop the Wallpapered Backsplash\\nOne of the trickiest things about backsplashes (tiled, painted, papered, anything!) is deciding where to stop. In some kitchens, there will be doors, trim, appliances, molding, or ends of counter top that make it very clear where the wallpaper installation should end. Other times, it’s not as evident.\\nMy original plan was to only tile the backsplash, and I used the width of our countertop and the height of the cabinets as my guide (as seen below).\\n\\nBut even as I stepped back, put my supplies away, and called the job done, the “tiling” really bothered me. The white paper felt random in the context of the rest of the kitchen; and instead of my eye drifting to the pretty paper, it kept drifting to the ceiling where there was none. Below is a quick snapshot I took as I debated (for weeks!) what to do about it.\\n\\nI finally decided that I needed to extend the wallpaper up the wall to the ceiling in order to make it work. After a quick calculation, I determined I had enough paper leftover to cover the remaining wall (I originally bought enough to “tile” the fireplace in the adjoining family room too).\\n\\nThe wonderful thing about installing wallpaper above cabinets is that there is usually nothing to work around…no outlets, no lights! As such, I just cut the paper into strips and put it right up, matching the pattern as I went around the kitchen.\\n\\nWe lived with just the backsplash area done for about 2 months before I finally did the rest of the wall, and to say the change was dramatic is an understatement. The wallpapered backsplash went from feeling random and disjointed to providing a fun and fresh detail that really woke up the entire kitchen.\\nIf your cabinets do not reach the ceiling or a soffit, I highly recommend wallpapering the area above the cabinets for the most visual impact.\\n\\n\\nIn the three years we lived in this house, I was never\\xa0really able to get used to the brown cabinets and brown counters and brown floors. But the small temporary changes I was able to make (like the wallpapered backsplash and this simple window valance) truly helped me like the space a lot more than the dull cave we started with. Although this wallpaper backsplash wasn’t the easiest DIY I’ve taken on, it was certainly one of the most rewarding!\\n\\nOther Renter-Friendly Kitchen Updates\\n\\nHow to Shiplap a Kitchen Island with Command Strips\\nA DIY Butcher Block Island Countertop (Anyone Can Do!)\\nAn Easy Way to Add Pattern to Your Pantry with Wrapping Paper\\n\\nWhether you rent or own, I suspect most of us have aspects of our homes we just don’t love.

It makes such a difference. Here’s another suggestion for you. Chalkboard vinyl on the panels of your cabinet doors. My son-in-law suggested that I paint my doors with the chalkboard paint, but I couldn’t bring myself to do something so permanent. I found the vinyl online though, on some sort of deal, and I LOVE IT. It is fun to label my cabinets, and it would cut way back on the brown in your kitchen. (I think it would coordinate with the black on your fridge and appliances, too.) Anyway, just a suggestion. I love your ideas.\\n\\n\\nStacey — June 7, 2018 @ 1:01 pm Reply\\nLove this!\\n\\n\\nNancy Glad — August 11, 2018 @ 8:16 am Reply\\nMegan, your info is great – many thanks. Any experience or suggestions for using wallpaper for a backsplash? I want to use nautical maps which are just heavy paper.

Personally, I’ve used peel-and-stick wallpaper over and over and over and have NEVER had it ruin the walls…including the hex paper shown in this post (we pulled it down after it being up for 2+ years).\\xa0\\nI do always test any paper before I do a full installation (often leaving a swatch up for a few weeks to make sure there isn’t any long-term damage). The most I’ve had peel-and-stick paper do is pull little specs of paint off, which are easily touched up.\\xa0\\nI have so much faith in it that I now use it more than paint in all of our rentals…which we usually move out of every 2-3 years.\\nHope that encourages you to give it a try!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBecky — March 7, 2020 @ 7:50 am Reply\\nDid you apply any kind of water proof coating?

Do you think that would be necessary?\\n\\n\\nthehomesihavemade — March 7, 2020 @ 8:11 am Reply\\nHi Becky!\\nNo, I don’t think that’s necessary at all. At least not for the paper we used. Most peel-and-stick papers are like a thick contact paper, so they can easily be wiped clean. I would just be sure not to pick a fabric-like wallpaper or one with texture, although even some of those would likely be fine.

And we have lived in North Carolina, Kansas, California and Virginia. That said, I would ALWAYS do a test on any wall and leave it up for a while before you do a full installation.\\nThird, most peel-and-stick wallpapers are wipeable/washable. So if the wallpaper DOES stay up, you’d be able to clean it without any issue. The white wallpaper in this post was wiped down with a wet rag constantly.\\nFinally, if you determine you do need something over the wallpaper, some sort of plexiglass/acrylic sheet could work (although it would be pricey) or you could try clear contact paper.\\xa0\\nHope those thoughts help a bit!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDS53 — October 12, 2020 @ 9:46 pm Reply\\nYou are so very inspiring!\\n\\n\\nthehomesihavemade — October 16, 2020 @ 8:51 am Reply\\nThanks so much…glad you stopped by!\\nMegan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShonda — April 14, 2022 @ 10:58 am Reply\\nAny thoughts on how you would manage an outside corner with wallpaper?\\n\\n\\nMegan — April 14, 2022 @ 12:03 pm Reply\\nHi Shonda!\\nI’m not sure what you mean by outside corner…do you mean one that protrudes outward rather than in?\\nI actually think paper bends easier around a protruding\\xa0corner, but it will still be tricky to keep it perfectly level. I’d give it a try going around the corner first. If you can’t get the follow-on paper to line up level, then you could technically cut it at the corner and start over, but you run the risk of the seam being really visible.\\xa0\\nIf you cut your paper 1-2″ taller than you need, you’d be able to turn the corner and not have any gap between the paper and the upper cabinets, even if it does go a little off as you make the bend.\\nDoes that help?\\nThanks!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContent Sidebar\\n\\nHi, I'm Megan!\\nI am a military spouse, mom to 3 young boys, and a constant creator.

See my full disclosure statement\\xa0here.\\nI’m sure that different brands vary in quality. While I cannot speak for all brands, I’m sharing my experience with this particular wallpaper.\\nSome questions I plan to cover are:\\n\\nIs it easy to install?\\nIs it a quality paper?\\nDoes it stick well?\\nDo you overlap it?\\nHow do you clean a wallpaper backsplash?\\nIs it really removable?\\n\\nYou can find the wallpaper pattern I used on Amazon. It’s also available at Wallpops. This is not the peel & stick tiles. It’s actually an 18 inch by 9 foot roll of peel and stick wallpaper. The scale of the pattern and the height of the roll were designed to work perfectly as a backsplash.\\nORIGINAL DESIGN & PLAN\\nTwo years ago, I designed and installed Ikea kitchen cabinets and counter-tops in my home office. You can read all about that process here. I love the design, storage and function of this space. But, I was worn out with the build and came up short with the decor.\\n\\nWhile I did make a small effort to decorate my office at the time, I wasn’t satisfied with the outcome. This month I plan to use my DIY skills and material I already have, to decorate it. I want to save my budget for other projects, so I don’t plan to spend much on this.\\nWhen I first installed the cabinets, I made a fabric pin board in this space. As time passed, I realized that I wasn’t using the cork board and the color and pattern didn’t really match the rest of my home. I also have plans to use the cork board in a different way. This is where I’m starting.\\n\\nSUPPLIES NEEDED\\n\\nREMOVABLE PEEL & STICK WALLPAPER BACKSPLASH\\n” target=”_blank”>PLASTIC SPREADER\\nX-ACTO KNIFE\\nTAPE MEASURE\\nCUTTING MAT (OPTIONAL)\\n\\n\\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN\\nLet’s cover a few important things up front. If your wall is freshly painted, hold off on applying the wallpaper. I would advise waiting for 4 weeks to let the paint fully cure. The wall surface needs to be clean and smooth. Do not attempt to apply wallpaper to textured walls, unpainted drywall or non-stick paint. If you are hanging it around outlets or switches, turn off the power, remove the covers and vacuum out any dust. You don’t want to get dust or debris on the adhesive backing of the wallpaper. I also don’t advise applying the wallpaper over caulk.\\nHOW TO APPLY A WALLPAPER BACKSPLASH\\nFirst I’m going to explain what the instructions said to do. Then I’m going to explain what I actually did and why.\\nPACKAGE INSTRUCTIONS\\n\\nStart with a smaller piece of wallpaper. Lay your roll of wallpaper on the counter and peel back about 12 inches of the backing.\\n\\nWorking from left to right, apply the wallpaper, starting at an edge or corner. Use your counter-top as a guide for level. Once it is positioned properly, smooth out and press it firmly with your plastic spreader. Again working from left to right.\\n\\nMeasure and cut out any outlets or switch covers with your cutting mat and utility knife.\\nTake care not to stretch the paper. HGTV has a quick and simple video for the process, if you need to see it.\\nHOW I ACTUALLY INSTALLED THE WALLPAPER BACKSPLASH\\nI had a few obstacles that prevented the above method from working. First, I have a piece of molding on the front of my upper cabinets to hide the cabinet lighting. The molding and lighting ended up being a big problem.\\nWhile I started out using the recommended method, the edges of my wallpaper were getting damaged. The wallpaper also began heading in a downward motion, because I had to unroll it on a slight angle. Thankfully, this paper was removable. So I peeled it off and came up with a new plan.\\nI laid the paper face down on my counter-top and peeled off the entire backing.\\n\\nThen I asked two of my kids to hold the paper up, while I positioned it and used my plastic spreader to smooth it out. Be sure to explain the process to your helpers first. I asked them to be careful, not to let the adhesive stick to itself before they lifted the paper.\\n\\nEven though this process sounds awkward, I have to say it, it was much easier. I had the paper up very quickly, it wasn’t damaged and it was level. I didn’t have to work around outlets, so I only had one seam. If you are measuring and cutting outlets, work with smaller pieces of wallpaper. I’ll explain how I hid the seams further down.\\nIS IT EASY TO INSTALL?\\nMany people hear peel & stick and think this is a simple project. Like any DIY project, patience will serve you well. There are always obstacles to work around and it’s never as strait forward as you originally think.\\nWith that said, I would put this project in the easy category. Give yourself enough margin, so you are not rushing through it.\\nIS IT A QUALITY PAPER?\\nThe paper I used was very good quality. It was on the thicker side and didn’t tear when I had to remove it from the wall. It has a matte vinyl feel. The two rolls were consistent in color and pattern. The edge of a new roll is designed to line up with the end of the previous roll. Although, I found mine to be slightly off. I’ll explain how I lined up the seams further down.\\nDOES IT STICK WELL?\\nIf you have a clean, smooth surface, it does stick well. I was very impressed with the adhesive on this wallpaper. It stuck firmly to the wall and was easy to smooth out during application. There are no bubbles or wrinkles and it is firmly stuck to the wall.\\nDO YOU OVERLAP IT?\\nThe instruction say to line up the ends of the wall paper, matching the pattern up. I tried to do it this way and found that the seam showed and the pattern was slightly off. Keep in mind, I’m a very detail oriented person.\\nMy fix? I overlapped the pattern. I want to be honest here. In all of my research, no one recommended to do this. I’m also not sure if this will be a problem over time. But, I have to say that the seam is invisible. I called my kids in and asked them to find the seam without touching the wallpaper. They couldn’t find it, even with careful attention. The black arrows below are pointing to the seam.\\n\\nI cut the wallpaper so the seam didn’t run through any of the dark gray solid lines. The adhesive stuck really well to the front of the previous piece of paper. If I were wallpapering an entire wall, I’m not sure I would have the patience to do this.\\nHOW DO YOU CLEAN A WALLPAPER BACKSPLASH?\\nThe directions say to wipe it down with a slightly damp cloth. It has a vinyl type finish on it, so I think it will wipe up well. However, I’m not sure spaghetti sauce would wipe off of it. Certain foods or smoke from cooking, might stain the white finish. I’m using it in an office environment, so I won’t be able to test it for you.\\nTo be fair, it is a very inexpensive product and is designed for temporary use. That’s why it’s removable. It’s also pretty simple to install. I feel certain, that if I tire of it after a few years, I can install a new paper without breaking the bank or wasting too much time.\\nIS IT REALLY REMOVABLE?\\nI did stick down about 3 feet of this paper and then removed it. It stuck really well to the wall. When I pulled it off, the paper didn’t tear and all of the adhesive came up with the paper. There was no damage to the paint or wall.\\nSince I haven’t tested removing it after it’s been up for a few years, I cannot speak to that. I do know from working with removable vinyl in my crafts, the adhesive becomes more permanent over time. Especially if it is in direct sunlight or if it comes into contact with heat. I’m not sure if this wallpaper is the same as removable vinyl. But I thought you would find this information helpful.\\nDO YOU NEED TO TRIM IT OUT WITH MOLDING?\\nAfter installing the wallpaper, I found that it looked O.K. without molding around it. There was no need to install trim. Here is a picture before the molding.\\n\\nI like the way it looks with molding. There is a gap between the back of my counter-top and the wall. Most kitchens have caulk in this gap. Since my counter-tops are in an office (dry environment) I didn’t caulk the gap. If you are in a kitchen, you will need stop the wallpaper before the caulk line. I’m not sure how this will look. You may want to remove the caulk, install the wallpaper and then re-caulk it.\\n\\nAnother option would be to stop the wallpaper before the caulk and apply a piece of cove molding over it. Since the molding is light and just decorative, I used double stick tape and a thin line of caulk to hold the molding in place. This held up well and I didn’t put a bunch of holes in the wall and molding with a brad nailer.\\nJOIN THE COMMUNITY\\nFor instant access to my free library and regular updates on blog posts, subscribe at the top sidebar or at the bottom of this post.

See my full disclosure statement\\xa0here.\\nI’m sure that different brands vary in quality. While I cannot speak for all brands, I’m sharing my experience with this particular wallpaper.\\nSome questions I plan to cover are:\\n\\nIs it easy to install?\\nIs it a quality paper?\\nDoes it stick well?\\nDo you overlap it?\\nHow do you clean a wallpaper backsplash?\\nIs it really removable?\\n\\nYou can find the wallpaper pattern I used on Amazon. It’s also available at Wallpops. This is not the peel & stick tiles. It’s actually an 18 inch by 9 foot roll of peel and stick wallpaper. The scale of the pattern and the height of the roll were designed to work perfectly as a backsplash.\\nORIGINAL DESIGN & PLAN\\nTwo years ago, I designed and installed Ikea kitchen cabinets and counter-tops in my home office. You can read all about that process here. I love the design, storage and function of this space. But, I was worn out with the build and came up short with the decor.\\n\\nWhile I did make a small effort to decorate my office at the time, I wasn’t satisfied with the outcome. This month I plan to use my DIY skills and material I already have, to decorate it. I want to save my budget for other projects, so I don’t plan to spend much on this.\\nWhen I first installed the cabinets, I made a fabric pin board in this space. As time passed, I realized that I wasn’t using the cork board and the color and pattern didn’t really match the rest of my home. I also have plans to use the cork board in a different way. This is where I’m starting.\\n\\nSUPPLIES NEEDED\\n\\nREMOVABLE PEEL & STICK WALLPAPER BACKSPLASH\\n” target=”_blank”>PLASTIC SPREADER\\nX-ACTO KNIFE\\nTAPE MEASURE\\nCUTTING MAT (OPTIONAL)\\n\\n\\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN\\nLet’s cover a few important things up front. If your wall is freshly painted, hold off on applying the wallpaper. I would advise waiting for 4 weeks to let the paint fully cure. The wall surface needs to be clean and smooth. Do not attempt to apply wallpaper to textured walls, unpainted drywall or non-stick paint. If you are hanging it around outlets or switches, turn off the power, remove the covers and vacuum out any dust. You don’t want to get dust or debris on the adhesive backing of the wallpaper. I also don’t advise applying the wallpaper over caulk.\\nHOW TO APPLY A WALLPAPER BACKSPLASH\\nFirst I’m going to explain what the instructions said to do. Then I’m going to explain what I actually did and why.\\nPACKAGE INSTRUCTIONS\\n\\nStart with a smaller piece of wallpaper. Lay your roll of wallpaper on the counter and peel back about 12 inches of the backing.\\n\\nWorking from left to right, apply the wallpaper, starting at an edge or corner. Use your counter-top as a guide for level. Once it is positioned properly, smooth out and press it firmly with your plastic spreader. Again working from left to right.\\n\\nMeasure and cut out any outlets or switch covers with your cutting mat and utility knife.\\nTake care not to stretch the paper. HGTV has a quick and simple video for the process, if you need to see it.\\nHOW I ACTUALLY INSTALLED THE WALLPAPER BACKSPLASH\\nI had a few obstacles that prevented the above method from working. First, I have a piece of molding on the front of my upper cabinets to hide the cabinet lighting. The molding and lighting ended up being a big problem.\\nWhile I started out using the recommended method, the edges of my wallpaper were getting damaged. The wallpaper also began heading in a downward motion, because I had to unroll it on a slight angle. Thankfully, this paper was removable. So I peeled it off and came up with a new plan.\\nI laid the paper face down on my counter-top and peeled off the entire backing.\\n\\nThen I asked two of my kids to hold the paper up, while I positioned it and used my plastic spreader to smooth it out. Be sure to explain the process to your helpers first. I asked them to be careful, not to let the adhesive stick to itself before they lifted the paper.\\n\\nEven though this process sounds awkward, I have to say it, it was much easier. I had the paper up very quickly, it wasn’t damaged and it was level. I didn’t have to work around outlets, so I only had one seam. If you are measuring and cutting outlets, work with smaller pieces of wallpaper. I’ll explain how I hid the seams further down.\\nIS IT EASY TO INSTALL?\\nMany people hear peel & stick and think this is a simple project. Like any DIY project, patience will serve you well. There are always obstacles to work around and it’s never as strait forward as you originally think.\\nWith that said, I would put this project in the easy category. Give yourself enough margin, so you are not rushing through it.\\nIS IT A QUALITY PAPER?\\nThe paper I used was very good quality. It was on the thicker side and didn’t tear when I had to remove it from the wall. It has a matte vinyl feel. The two rolls were consistent in color and pattern. The edge of a new roll is designed to line up with the end of the previous roll. Although, I found mine to be slightly off. I’ll explain how I lined up the seams further down.\\nDOES IT STICK WELL?\\nIf you have a clean, smooth surface, it does stick well. I was very impressed with the adhesive on this wallpaper. It stuck firmly to the wall and was easy to smooth out during application. There are no bubbles or wrinkles and it is firmly stuck to the wall.\\nDO YOU OVERLAP IT?\\nThe instruction say to line up the ends of the wall paper, matching the pattern up.

I called my kids in and asked them to find the seam without touching the wallpaper. They couldn’t find it, even with careful attention.

The adhesive stuck really well to the front of the previous piece of paper.

The instructions for installing a washable wallpaper backsplash are the same, but since the original post, we have updated the backsplash with new wallpaper.\\nAt the end of the DIY, you will see not only how easy this washable backsplash is to install, but also how easy it is to change it when you fancy a new design. There are examples of making waterproof wallpaper splashbacks in the bathroom, plus other wallpaper decorating ideas for the home.\\nIn the UK my friends say the word backsplash, the other way around, splashback. Having been bought up in 2 cultures, I’m happy using the word either way.\\nI know you can get washable vinyl wallpaper, which is sometimes used as a kitchen backsplash, but they are limited in designs. With this method, we use for making a wallpaper kitchen backsplash you can use any wallpaper. It doesn’t have to be waterproof either.\\nDIY Kitchen Wallpaper Backsplash (splashback) with wallpaper\\nMy friend had spotted some gorgeous Dragonfly wallpaper by Harlequin. Even though it wasn’t a wallpaper specially designed for kitchens, she was determined to have it. That’s when we worked out the best way to make a kitchen wallpaper splashback (backsplash).\\nThe wallpaper is protected by a piece of glass and is screwed to the wall. The really awesome thing about this DIY splashback is that it’s really easy to unscrew the glass and change the wallpaper when you feel like something different.\\nYou could even put something other than wallpaper behind the glass, such as a photo collage, or other images printed on paper. I’m a huge fan of decorating and crafting with old maps, so I would be tempted to use an old map for my kitchen backsplash. However, I can see myself getting distracted by the map, instead of concentrating on my cooking.\\n\\nWe’re a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.\\nWhat you need\\n\\nWallpaper – Depending on the size of your kitchen splashback (backsplash) and how your wallpaper pattern fits will determine how much wallpaper you use. Usually, you would need no more than a quarter roll. The wallpaper we used was a Harlequin Wallpaper, Palmetto Demoiselle, which comes in several different colorways, eBay is a great place to look for odd or even part rolls of wallpaper.\\nWallpaper paste/adhesive – I recommend using a wallpaper paste that has anti-fungal properties. You can buy an anti-fungal agent to add the adhesive. This will help stop the wallpaper from going moldy with any kitchen condensation.\\nRotary cutter and mat\\nPlywood base – This will need to be the size of your DIY splashback. We used a 5.5mm hardwood ply.\\nGlass – This again will be the size of your kitchen backsplash. We used a 4mm toughened low iron glass which we got cut to size at the store. We also had 4 screw holes drilled into each corner of the glass at the store. Make sure the glass is heatproof safety glass.\\nDomed mirror screws – 4, one for each corner.\\nTile trim – The size of the trim depends on the thickness of the backsplash. We used a 12mm wrap round trim in chrome. You don’t have to have a trim, it’s mainly about aesthetics. This can be purchased from your local tiling store.\\n\\n\\nHow to make your DIY Splashback\\nStep1: First, carefully measure the exact area of where you would like the kitchen backsplash to be. Ours was a square just above the cooker hob.\\nWe were installing the wallpapered backsplash on a newly fitted kitchen with a freshly plastered and painted blank wall.\\n\\nStep 2. Take these measurements to your local DIY/Home store and get the plywood and glass cut to the size. At the same time get them to drill the screw holes into the corner of the glass.\\n\\nStep 3. Next, carefully think about how your wallpaper pattern design will fit on the backsplash before cutting it to the measurements. With the dragonfly wallpaper design, we wanted whole dragonflies in the middle of the backsplash. Therefore, we ended up with one wallpaper roll width in the middle and two-part widths on either side.\\n\\nStep 4. Next, to make sure that the wallpaper will stick firmly, key your plywood. Do this by coating the cut plywood with a layer of wallpaper paste and leaving it to dry.\\n\\nStep 5. Once the key has dried, paste the board again with wallpaper paste. Then stick the wallpaper sheets down one at a time. Make sure the pattern lines up properly. Use a wallpaper roller to squeeze out any air bubbles. Leave the wallpaper to dry thoroughly.\\n\\nAttaching the backsplash to the wall and making it waterproof\\nStep 6. Next, comes the tricky bit of attaching the plywood and glass to the wall. You will probably need more than one pair of hands for this stage. Attach the plywood and glass to the wall at the same time using the same mirror screws.\\nMeasure where the screw holes will need to be in the wall and then drill the holes and add the appropriate wall plug. Do the same with the wallpapered plywood.\\nThe mirror screws go through the glass and wallpapered plywood and then into the wall at the back. Use a chrome dome cap to finish off the screws.\\nWe used a low iron toughened glass for this splashback, because if it’s not low iron the glass can have a green hue to it.\\n\\n\\nStep 7. Finally, the wallpapered kitchen backsplash has a raw edge, to neaten this up we fitted a chrome tile trim.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow To Change The Wallpaper\\nAfter six years of the dragonfly wallpaper as a backsplash, it was time for a change. The back wall in the kitchen had been wallpapered with a Lucy Tiffney wallpaper and my friend Wendy wanted the backsplash to match.\\n\\nStep 1: The first thing to do was to remove the old backsplash. This only took about 10 minutes. First, the chrome trim was removed from the edges of the glass. They just simply slid out. Next, the four screws were removed from the glass and the glass plate lifted away.\\n\\nStep 2: The plywood back with the dragonfly wallpaper was laid down on the counter. We didn’t bother removing the old wallpaper but just stuck the new design on top of the old. As with the original backsplash, we made sure the pattern matched up. We used the same adhesive and technique as above.\\n\\n\\nStep 3: Once the new wallpaper has dried, screw it all back into the wall with the same glass front as before. Then slide the chrome trim back into place. It’s really that easy and takes less than an hour to change the wallpaper backsplash.\\n\\nFAQs About This DIY and Kitchen\\nWhy glass instead of plexiglass (plastic)?\\nPlexiglass scratches very easily, crazes and is much more difficult to clean well. Also, plexiglass will melt with the heat and collect grease. Glass is more heat-resistant and is easy enough to clean. The cost is about on par with the plexiglass.

The instructions for installing a washable wallpaper backsplash are the same, but since the original post, we have updated the backsplash with new wallpaper.\\nAt the end of the DIY, you will see not only how easy this washable backsplash is to install, but also how easy it is to change it when you fancy a new design. There are examples of making waterproof wallpaper splashbacks in the bathroom, plus other wallpaper decorating ideas for the home.\\nIn the UK my friends say the word backsplash, the other way around, splashback. Having been bought up in 2 cultures, I’m happy using the word either way.\\nI know you can get washable vinyl wallpaper, which is sometimes used as a kitchen backsplash, but they are limited in designs. With this method, we use for making a wallpaper kitchen backsplash you can use any wallpaper. It doesn’t have to be waterproof either.\\nDIY Kitchen Wallpaper Backsplash (splashback) with wallpaper\\nMy friend had spotted some gorgeous Dragonfly wallpaper by Harlequin. Even though it wasn’t a wallpaper specially designed for kitchens, she was determined to have it. That’s when we worked out the best way to make a kitchen wallpaper splashback (backsplash).\\nThe wallpaper is protected by a piece of glass and is screwed to the wall. The really awesome thing about this DIY splashback is that it’s really easy to unscrew the glass and change the wallpaper when you feel like something different.\\nYou could even put something other than wallpaper behind the glass, such as a photo collage, or other images printed on paper. I’m a huge fan of decorating and crafting with old maps, so I would be tempted to use an old map for my kitchen backsplash. However, I can see myself getting distracted by the map, instead of concentrating on my cooking.\\n\\nWe’re a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.\\nWhat you need\\n\\nWallpaper – Depending on the size of your kitchen splashback (backsplash) and how your wallpaper pattern fits will determine how much wallpaper you use. Usually, you would need no more than a quarter roll. The wallpaper we used was a Harlequin Wallpaper, Palmetto Demoiselle, which comes in several different colorways, eBay is a great place to look for odd or even part rolls of wallpaper.\\nWallpaper paste/adhesive – I recommend using a wallpaper paste that has anti-fungal properties. You can buy an anti-fungal agent to add the adhesive. This will help stop the wallpaper from going moldy with any kitchen condensation.\\nRotary cutter and mat\\nPlywood base – This will need to be the size of your DIY splashback. We used a 5.5mm hardwood ply.\\nGlass – This again will be the size of your kitchen backsplash. We used a 4mm toughened low iron glass which we got cut to size at the store. We also had 4 screw holes drilled into each corner of the glass at the store. Make sure the glass is heatproof safety glass.\\nDomed mirror screws – 4, one for each corner.\\nTile trim – The size of the trim depends on the thickness of the backsplash. We used a 12mm wrap round trim in chrome. You don’t have to have a trim, it’s mainly about aesthetics. This can be purchased from your local tiling store.\\n\\n\\nHow to make your DIY Splashback\\nStep1: First, carefully measure the exact area of where you would like the kitchen backsplash to be. Ours was a square just above the cooker hob.\\nWe were installing the wallpapered backsplash on a newly fitted kitchen with a freshly plastered and painted blank wall.\\n\\nStep 2. Take these measurements to your local DIY/Home store and get the plywood and glass cut to the size. At the same time get them to drill the screw holes into the corner of the glass.\\n\\nStep 3. Next, carefully think about how your wallpaper pattern design will fit on the backsplash before cutting it to the measurements. With the dragonfly wallpaper design, we wanted whole dragonflies in the middle of the backsplash. Therefore, we ended up with one wallpaper roll width in the middle and two-part widths on either side.\\n\\nStep 4. Next, to make sure that the wallpaper will stick firmly, key your plywood. Do this by coating the cut plywood with a layer of wallpaper paste and leaving it to dry.\\n\\nStep 5. Once the key has dried, paste the board again with wallpaper paste. Then stick the wallpaper sheets down one at a time. Make sure the pattern lines up properly. Use a wallpaper roller to squeeze out any air bubbles. Leave the wallpaper to dry thoroughly.\\n\\nAttaching the backsplash to the wall and making it waterproof\\nStep 6. Next, comes the tricky bit of attaching the plywood and glass to the wall. You will probably need more than one pair of hands for this stage. Attach the plywood and glass to the wall at the same time using the same mirror screws.\\nMeasure where the screw holes will need to be in the wall and then drill the holes and add the appropriate wall plug. Do the same with the wallpapered plywood.\\nThe mirror screws go through the glass and wallpapered plywood and then into the wall at the back. Use a chrome dome cap to finish off the screws.\\nWe used a low iron toughened glass for this splashback, because if it’s not low iron the glass can have a green hue to it.\\n\\n\\nStep 7. Finally, the wallpapered kitchen backsplash has a raw edge, to neaten this up we fitted a chrome tile trim.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow To Change The Wallpaper\\nAfter six years of the dragonfly wallpaper as a backsplash, it was time for a change. The back wall in the kitchen had been wallpapered with a Lucy Tiffney wallpaper and my friend Wendy wanted the backsplash to match.\\n\\nStep 1: The first thing to do was to remove the old backsplash. This only took about 10 minutes. First, the chrome trim was removed from the edges of the glass. They just simply slid out. Next, the four screws were removed from the glass and the glass plate lifted away.\\n\\nStep 2: The plywood back with the dragonfly wallpaper was laid down on the counter. We didn’t bother removing the old wallpaper but just stuck the new design on top of the old. As with the original backsplash, we made sure the pattern matched up. We used the same adhesive and technique as above.\\n\\n\\nStep 3: Once the new wallpaper has dried, screw it all back into the wall with the same glass front as before. Then slide the chrome trim back into place. It’s really that easy and takes less than an hour to change the wallpaper backsplash.\\n\\nFAQs About This DIY and Kitchen\\nWhy glass instead of plexiglass (plastic)?\\nPlexiglass scratches very easily, crazes and is much more difficult to clean well. Also, plexiglass will melt with the heat and collect grease. Glass is more heat-resistant and is easy enough to clean. The cost is about on par with the plexiglass. Make sure you use heatproof safety glass.\\nDo you have to have special heat resistant glass?\\nIt was safety glass and a low iron glass to avoid a green tint.\\nWhere did you get the glass and how much did it cost for a piece that large?\\nIt was from a local builders merchant in the UK and cost about £100 ($140), which included the pre-drilled holes.\\nHow has it held up to the heat from the stove?\\nThe wallpaper has been up for almost five years now and it still looks as good as the day it was installed.

Boho Chic In Suede\\nSuede is on track to be a standout for Spring/Summer 2025, on everything from accessories as larger bags to skirts and outerwear. In addition, we can expect to see a growth in matching sets as well, a suede blazer paired with a suede skirt or trousers.\\nThe men\\'s SS25 shows already hinted at this trend, showcasing a 13% increase in matching sets on the runway. For women, the suede fabric in general is expected to grow with +17% among women between July-September compared to the previous year. And it doesn’t stop there, for the beginning of 2025 is suede loafers expected to increase with +30%, mainly adopted by the edgy consumer.

Aquatic Wonderland\\nWe can expect aquatic influences in 2025 that go beyond the classic nautical marine aesthetic, instead the inspiration will take us deep into the world of water and everything that exists within it. Think vibrant tiles from a pool, tropical blues that evoke the soothing depths of the ocean, the caudal fin, the shells of aquatic animals, and mermaid-inspired dresses.\\nFor Spring/Summer 2025, we anticipate a trend centered around aquatic influences to evolve. This is indeed a theme for the more edgy, fashion-forward consumer, infused with a touch of fashion extravagance. However, we can also expect to see these influences among mainstream consumers, playing with shades of blue and metallic colors alongside lustrous fabrics.

These polos were often styled buttoned up, adding structure to the overall look. For decades, the polo shirt has been a symbol of casual sophistication in men’s fashion. However, in recent years, this iconic piece has made a stylish shift, becoming just as essential in women\\'s fashion, but with a decidedly feminine twist.

Designers during Spring/Summer 2025 were blending classic elements, like the signature collar and buttoned placket with new shapes and fabrics that elevate the garment from its sporty roots.\\nSlimmer fits, cropped versions, and softer fabrics like ribbed knits and stretch cottons will make the polo shirt shine during 2025.

Well, OK, it’s been building for a few years; elements of ‘80s style have been popping up on the runways and IRL for a few years. But 2025 is the perfect time to take it to the next level! Channel the ‘80s with floral print dresses and jackets, bold earrings, embellished tops, and lots of rich, deep, bold colors.

Under the wing of designer Chemena Kamali, the beloved fashion line made a big splash in 2024 and had us revisiting the boho-chic era of the mid-2000s.

Just like Sienna Miller in the 2000s, tone down the flowiness with a touch of leather and suede, like a motorcycle jacket, tall boots, or a studded bag. The boho look is a natural match for the Bella Hadid-inspired horsegirl aesthetic; if the horsegirl left the stables and dressed up for the night, this is what she’d be wearing. The boho revival also pairs well with Pinterest’s “goddess” trend, which is all about flowing waves and curls, gold jewelry, and draped, form-fitting dresses.\\n\\nMonki\\nDistressed faux leather jacket\\n$90ASOS\\n\\nZara\\nCotton & Linen Short Embroidered Dress\\n$50zara\\n3.

Though the hot pink heyday of Barbiecore is firmly in the rear-view mirror, dolls are still having a moment. In 2025, expect to see more candy-colored fashion and surrealism-inspired accessories, a la Marc Jacobs’s instantly viral fall 2024 show; as evidence that the trend has (plastic) legs, Kaia Gerber recently wore a head-to-toe Marc Jacobs ensemble on the December cover of Vogue, complete with oversized gloves and a shellacked hairstyle. To bring the doll look to life in your own day-to-day, think of bright colors and cheery pastels, platform Mary Jane shoes, big lashes, and either teeny-tiny accessories like handbags or cartoonishly oversized jewels.\\n\\nMarc Jacobs\\nShoulder Bag\\n$150Marc Jacobs\\n\\nMarc Jacobs\\nPurple 'The Metallic Kiki' Knee High Boots\\n$595SSENSE\\n4.

Think deep, rich red, just like in-season cherries shining in a bag at the grocery store. This color lends itself well to almost every corner of your wardrobe, from a statement coat to sunglasses to a date-night dress. Even a hair clip counts!

Rooted in a sense of “soft power,” which Vogue’s Laird Borelli-Persson connected to designers encouraging “an openness to a sense of wonder” in her analysis of the shows, these trends can be embraced in more ways than one. And key themes can already be incorporated into your wardrobe.\\nConsider spring’s outerwear stories, which reimagine lightweight jackets of all types, particularly sporty styles for the season ahead. For inspiration on how to wear these jackets from now, look no further than Bottega, where an elasticated windbreaker was styled with fluid trousers. A zip-up à la Gucci works equally well here—just throw an overcoat on top. Suede will continue to trend as well, so if you invested this fall, keep wearing it! At Prada, caramel suede was paired with dark grey—a new go-to winter color combo to try in the new year.\\nSpeaking of the new year, it’s the perfect opportunity to refresh your work staples. For the office and beyond, we’ll be seeing new takes on tailoring—both oversized and shrunken—to suit your 2025 style resolutions. There are plenty of relaxed suiting options to add to your rotation right now—make it full look for that inimitable Saint Laurent swagger.\\nAs for the print that reigned supreme on the spring/summer runways? It wasn’t a floral or an animal but plaid. The autumnal pattern was already a favorite this fall, but it seems like fashion wasn’t done with it for spring, rendering it in softer colors and shapes. If plaid was already a trend you incorporated this season, look to the runways for ideas on how to print clash—we saw it styled as full ensembles in various checks, but also contrasted with polkadots and stripes.\\nBelow, a look at the three key spring/summer 2025 fashion trends you can wear now—a running list we’ll continue to update as spring’s coveted deliveries land in stores.\\nRunway: Loewe Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025; Prada Spring 2025; Miu Miu Spring 2025; Gucci Spring 2025\\nPhotos: Courtesy of GoRunway.com\\nSpring Outerwear Stories\\nA sporty sensibility carried over from fashion’s Olympics fervor pervaded the spring/summer 2025 runways. Sabato de Sarno showed various fitted zip-up jackets at Gucci, while Bottega and Miu Miu reimagined the wind breaker—Matthieu Blazy notably lined his in plaid, a carryover from fall we’ll get into next. But other kinds of lightweight outerwear were anlso introduced. At Prada, Miuccia and Raf Simons showed a suede style, proof that fashion’s ongoing obsession with the texture isn’t going anywhere. A cropped leather cape made an appearance at Loewe, upleveling the boho staple we were reacquainted with last spring. Investing in next-season outerwear now doesn’t mean you have to wait until March to wear your pieces—layer similar styles from Gucci and Loewe under heavier coats to maximize their cost per wear.\\n\\nGucci\\nembroidered wool and silk hooded jacket\\n$4,300GUCCI\\n\\nSacai\\ntwill-paneled hoodie\\n$915MYTHERESA\\n\\n& Other Stories\\nbelted patch-pocket jacket\\n$219& OTHER STORIES\\n\\nLoewe\\nballoon jacket in nappa lambskin\\n$7,250LOEWE\\n\\nZara\\nfaux suede jacket\\n$70ZARA\\n\\nSkall Studio\\nGaby jacket\\n$800FWRD\\nRunway: Acne Studios Spring 2025; Kallmeyer Spring 2025; Tod’s Spring 2025; The Row Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025\\nPhotos: Courtesy of GoRunway.com\\nChecks and Balances\\nPlaid may be synonymous with fall—where it indeed saw a resurgence this season—but its presence in the spring collections takes on a softer tune. Borelli-Persson described these checks best as “Nirvana meets Country Living… for any season or type of weather” in her trend report. The Row’s ‘Tavishina’ coat in look 29 exemplifies the fashion mood, with an energizing combination of beige, black, and baby blue squares that was styled with pinstripe pants and a plain white button-up for a harmonious, minimalist-approved take on print mixing. Blazy meanwhile played with a classic color scheme of browns, greys, and white, but showed it as an oversized shacket meets coat hybrid. At Tod’s checks were playfully introduced once more, worn inside out as a full ensemble. In New York, Daniella Kallmeyer furthered the artful drape with a fluid blouse, while Acne Studios dabbled in the art of the clash (nails included!) and incorporated another theme seen in the resort 2025 trends: the bubble hem. This ’90s-inspired look can be achieved now with printed pieces from the likes of Massimo Dutti, Ralph Lauren, or Zara—and styled with pattern opposites for a true runway-coded look.\\n\\nBottega Veneta\\nchecked cotton trench coat\\n$3,900BOTTEGA VENETA\\n\\nDries Van Noten\\ngathered checked crepe maxi dress\\n$2,110NET-A-PORTER\\n\\nRalph Lauren\\nplaid cotton twill workshirt\\n$168RALPH LAUREN\\n\\nMassimo Dutti\\ndraped neck check shirt\\n$120MASSIMO DUTTI\\n\\nAcne Studios\\nsingle-breasted coat\\n$2,150MYTHERESA\\n$2,150SSENSE\\n\\nZara\\nplaid flannel shirt\\n$46ZARA\\nRunway: Tory Burch Spring 2025; Stella McCartney Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025; Saint Laurent Spring 2025; Bally Spring 2025\\nPhotos: Courtesy of GoRunway.com\\nNew Business Codes\\nWe’re leaving the office siren behind for spring, and embracing new tailoring codes for 2025.

A happy medium can be found at Saint Laurent, where the many full suiting looks in the collection were inspired by the house founder, and meant to convey “control and power,” as designer Anthony Vaccarello told Vogue’s Mark Holgate post-show backstage.

Rooted in a sense of “soft power,” which Vogue’s Laird Borelli-Persson connected to designers encouraging “an openness to a sense of wonder” in her analysis of the shows, these trends can be embraced in more ways than one. And key themes can already be incorporated into your wardrobe.\\nConsider spring’s outerwear stories, which reimagine lightweight jackets of all types, particularly sporty styles for the season ahead. For inspiration on how to wear these jackets from now, look no further than Bottega, where an elasticated windbreaker was styled with fluid trousers. A zip-up à la Gucci works equally well here—just throw an overcoat on top. Suede will continue to trend as well, so if you invested this fall, keep wearing it! At Prada, caramel suede was paired with dark grey—a new go-to winter color combo to try in the new year.\\nSpeaking of the new year, it’s the perfect opportunity to refresh your work staples. For the office and beyond, we’ll be seeing new takes on tailoring—both oversized and shrunken—to suit your 2025 style resolutions. There are plenty of relaxed suiting options to add to your rotation right now—make it full look for that inimitable Saint Laurent swagger.\\nAs for the print that reigned supreme on the spring/summer runways? It wasn’t a floral or an animal but plaid. The autumnal pattern was already a favorite this fall, but it seems like fashion wasn’t done with it for spring, rendering it in softer colors and shapes. If plaid was already a trend you incorporated this season, look to the runways for ideas on how to print clash—we saw it styled as full ensembles in various checks, but also contrasted with polkadots and stripes.\\nBelow, a look at the three key spring/summer 2025 fashion trends you can wear now—a running list we’ll continue to update as spring’s coveted deliveries land in stores.\\nRunway: Loewe Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025; Prada Spring 2025; Miu Miu Spring 2025; Gucci Spring 2025\\nPhotos: Courtesy of GoRunway.com\\nSpring Outerwear Stories\\nA sporty sensibility carried over from fashion’s Olympics fervor pervaded the spring/summer 2025 runways. Sabato de Sarno showed various fitted zip-up jackets at Gucci, while Bottega and Miu Miu reimagined the wind breaker—Matthieu Blazy notably lined his in plaid, a carryover from fall we’ll get into next. But other kinds of lightweight outerwear were anlso introduced. At Prada, Miuccia and Raf Simons showed a suede style, proof that fashion’s ongoing obsession with the texture isn’t going anywhere. A cropped leather cape made an appearance at Loewe, upleveling the boho staple we were reacquainted with last spring. Investing in next-season outerwear now doesn’t mean you have to wait until March to wear your pieces—layer similar styles from Gucci and Loewe under heavier coats to maximize their cost per wear.\\n\\nGucci\\nembroidered wool and silk hooded jacket\\n$4,300GUCCI\\n\\nSacai\\ntwill-paneled hoodie\\n$915MYTHERESA\\n\\n& Other Stories\\nbelted patch-pocket jacket\\n$219& OTHER STORIES\\n\\nLoewe\\nballoon jacket in nappa lambskin\\n$7,250LOEWE\\n\\nZara\\nfaux suede jacket\\n$70ZARA\\n\\nSkall Studio\\nGaby jacket\\n$800FWRD\\nRunway: Acne Studios Spring 2025; Kallmeyer Spring 2025; Tod’s Spring 2025; The Row Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025\\nPhotos: Courtesy of GoRunway.com\\nChecks and Balances\\nPlaid may be synonymous with fall—where it indeed saw a resurgence this season—but its presence in the spring collections takes on a softer tune. Borelli-Persson described these checks best as “Nirvana meets Country Living… for any season or type of weather” in her trend report. The Row’s ‘Tavishina’ coat in look 29 exemplifies the fashion mood, with an energizing combination of beige, black, and baby blue squares that was styled with pinstripe pants and a plain white button-up for a harmonious, minimalist-approved take on print mixing. Blazy meanwhile played with a classic color scheme of browns, greys, and white, but showed it as an oversized shacket meets coat hybrid. At Tod’s checks were playfully introduced once more, worn inside out as a full ensemble. In New York, Daniella Kallmeyer furthered the artful drape with a fluid blouse, while Acne Studios dabbled in the art of the clash (nails included!) and incorporated another theme seen in the resort 2025 trends: the bubble hem. This ’90s-inspired look can be achieved now with printed pieces from the likes of Massimo Dutti, Ralph Lauren, or Zara—and styled with pattern opposites for a true runway-coded look.\\n\\nBottega Veneta\\nchecked cotton trench coat\\n$3,900BOTTEGA VENETA\\n\\nDries Van Noten\\ngathered checked crepe maxi dress\\n$2,110NET-A-PORTER\\n\\nRalph Lauren\\nplaid cotton twill workshirt\\n$168RALPH LAUREN\\n\\nMassimo Dutti\\ndraped neck check shirt\\n$120MASSIMO DUTTI\\n\\nAcne Studios\\nsingle-breasted coat\\n$2,150MYTHERESA\\n$2,150SSENSE\\n\\nZara\\nplaid flannel shirt\\n$46ZARA\\nRunway: Tory Burch Spring 2025; Stella McCartney Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025; Saint Laurent Spring 2025; Bally Spring 2025\\nPhotos: Courtesy of GoRunway.com\\nNew Business Codes\\nWe’re leaving the office siren behind for spring, and embracing new tailoring codes for 2025.

If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission.\\nA new season means a new start—most excitingly, perhaps, for our collective closets. (I have a feeling you can relate.) With the first major spring 2025 fashion trends hitting the runways and streets, there’s plenty of fresh inspiration to be found right now.\\nAs a shopping editor with a major focus on style, I’ve been keeping a close eye on fashion month street style and spring’s catwalks, taking note of emerging trends in person and online. And the vibe for the year ahead is all about you—projecting a sense of your true self to the world. Sure, that’s the point of personal style, but after a few years dominated by quiet (and, some might say, boring) luxury, it’s now trendier than ever to dress for your own ideal. Accessories like bag charms are popping up everywhere; super-layered looks are the norm; bold styling choices are making staples like everyday leggings and skinny pants feel daring. It’s a sartorial free-for-all.\\nOf course, I also picked up on some more specific pieces, colors, and vibes, should you want a clearer road map for the year ahead. Boho style is officially here to stay, as is classic American prep (and a close cousin influenced by coastal living). And petal pink and pistachio green are shaping up to be the colors of the year, according to labels like Tory Burch, Tibi, and Simone Rocha.

Bohemian daydream\\nFrom left: Chloé, Valentino, Fendi\\nMarc Piasecki/Victor VIRGILE/Estrop/Getty Images\\nBoho’s been back for a year now, but spring’s best runways took the ’70s-inflected aesthetic in its dreamiest direction yet. Sheer fabrics and handicraft detailing abounded in the Chloé, Valentino, Fendi, and Armani collections, which went heavy on beading and embroidery. The attitude extended to hair too; labels like Elena Velez and Cucculelli Shaheen adorned models’ long hair with flowy ribbons and gold jewelry. I’m all for layering sheer pieces and investing in vintage gowns—but you can get the same effect by, say, throwing on a pair of lace tights and leaving your hair messy when you’re off to brunch.\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nAdrianna Papell Beaded Ankle-Length Dress\\n~$329~ $299Amazon\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nMadewell Anouk Platform Clog Sandals\\n$198Madewell\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nDôen Henri Top\\n$220Net-A-Porter\\n$218Dôen\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nJ.Crew Collection Sheer Layered Sequin Skirt\\n$148J.Crew\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nFree People Boca Bow Layer Necklace\\n$48Free People\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nMilumia Floral Lace Pantyhose\\n$14Amazon\\n2. Petal pink\\nFrom left: Brandon Maxwell, Miu Miu, ChanelGeorge Chinsee/WWD/Kristy Sparow/Getty Images\\nPastels always trend this time of year, but I can’t recall a recent season when powder pink felt this fresh. The whisper-soft shade graced too many spring catwalks to count—and while most outfits leaned feminine, they balanced the color’s usual associations with some bite. Pared-back styling made models feel grown-up at Khaite and Brandon Maxwell; Alaïa employed extreme cutouts for some sex appeal; weirdo layering embraced the female gaze at Miu Miu, Valentino, and Chanel. So while you’re welcome to wear petal pink however you wish, the real trend this season is juxtaposition—mixing the airy with the hard-edged. These pieces will get you started.\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nAbercrombie & Fitch Mixed Fabric Bubble Hem Midi-Dress\\n~$100~ $80Abercrombie\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nHollister Soft Stretch Seamless Fabric Longline Baby Tee\\n$18Hollister\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nWilfred Rhyme Blouse\\n$98Aritzia\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nMadewell Slouchy Straight Pants\\n$118Madewell\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nSam Edelman Kallen Sneakers\\n$90Amazon\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nJW Pei Addisyn Shoulder Bag\\n~$89~ $76Amazon\\n3. Elevated athleisure\\nFrom left: Ferragamo, Tory Burch, Tod’s\\nVictor VIRGILE/WWD/Getty Images\\nA decade after normcore turned everyday essentials like gray hoodies and black leggings into fashion statements, luxury labels are once again finding inspiration in the least glamorous pieces in everyone’s wardrobe. At Ferragamo, models looked like they were leaving ballet class; at Tory Burch, the pool; at Tod’s, track practice. None of these pieces (save for that sequined Tory tank) are showstoppers that would look out of place in the gym or on a coffee run—the appeal here comes down to smart styling. Spend a moment considering color, texture, and layering, and your basics will look like luxury pieces.\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nThe Frankie Shop Eva Tank\\n$79Net-A-Porter\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nLululemon Scuba Mid-Rise Wide-Leg Pants\\n$118Lululemon\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nEverlane Laid-Back Half-Zip Sweatshirt\\n$98Everlane\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nCadmus High-Waist Yoga Shorts\\n$15Walmart\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nDesign by Olivia Seamless Sports Bra\\n$17Amazon\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nCRZ Yoga Butterluxe High-Waisted Lounge Leggings\\n$32Amazon\\n4.

Ladies who lunch\\nFrom left: Gucci, Chanel, Louis Vuitton\\nThe Washington Post/Kristy Sparow/Peter White/Getty Images\\nTweed was on everyone’s mind this season, perhaps because loud luxury is back (or maybe because Chanel was in search of a new creative director). Whatever motivated the big swing toward ladylike style, I’m not upset—some old-school elegance is never a bad addition to your wardrobe, trendy or not. Chanel did its usual thing; Gucci and Louis Vuitton found muses in society women; Celine essentially released its version of a Chanel collection, featuring just a hint of camp. So no matter your tax bracket, it’s a great time to invest in a classic dress or a knit cardigan worthy of Jackie O. Keep things from getting too tradwife by introducing some high-low friction with jeans or unexpected footwear like sneakers and clogs.\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nMango Tweed Jacket with Zip\\n$140Nordstrom\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nH&M Tapered Dress Pants\\n$35H&M\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nHobemty Sleeveless Tweed Dress\\n$40Amazon\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nJaxxon Bezeled Pearl Stud Earrings\\n$129Jaxxon\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nBoden Holly Collared Knitted Jacket\\n$190Boden\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nIdealSanxun Tweed Miniskirt\\n$33Amazon\\n6. Slim-cut pants\\nFrom left: Proenza Schouler, Sportmax, MuglerVictor VIRGILE/Estrop/Getty Images\\nWhile much has been made of the return of skinny jeans, we’d like to offer a touch of pushback: This season’s best styles are technically slim, not proper skinny. (It’s a small but important distinction!) Slim-cut pants featured heavily at Prada, McQueen, Sportmax, Mugler, and Aaron Esh, while everyone and their mother has heard about Alix Earle’s recent love affair with the silhouette. The distinction between straight, slim, and skinny varies wildly between my favorite denim brands, but each of the picks below fits tight through the thighs and begins to flare ever-so-subtly through the leg. Style yours with a white T-shirt, a crewneck cardigan, and black booties to go full Parisian chic.\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nH&M Slim-Straight High Ankle Jeans\\n$40H&M\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nFrame Le Garçon Boyfriend Jeans\\n$238Nordstrom\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nMadewell Stovepipe Jeans\\n$138Madewell\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nLevi’s 312 Shaping Slim Jeans\\n~$70~ $49Amazon\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nVeronica Beard Renzo Pants\\n$395Nordstrom\\n$395Shopbop\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nSpanx PerfectFit Ponte Slim-Straight Pants\\n$148Nordstrom\\n$148Spanx\\n7. Pops of pistachio\\nFrom left: Tory Burch, Tove, Simone Rocha\\nVictor VIRGILE/Getty Images\\nWith early-2010s staples like big bags and cropped leather jackets back in the zeitgeist, it was only a matter of time until one of the biggest colors of the era came along with them. I’m talking, of course, about mint green, which is staging a comeback (with a little more verdancy for 2025) as pistachio. I spotted the shade on dresses at Tove and Chloé, bottoms at Tibi and Tory Burch, and accessories at Prada and Simone Rocha. It’s undeniable—and somehow still under the radar. Remedy that with the pieces below.\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nPistola Alessia Dress\\n~$178~ $125Revolve\\n$188Pistola\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nH&M Cotton Shirtdress with Belt\\n$45H&M\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nAbercrombie & Fitch Asymmetrical Button Sweater Tank\\n~$60~ $48Abercrombie\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nJ.Crew Cashmere Shrunken Crewneck Sweater\\n$118J.Crew\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nBirkenstock Madrid Big Buckle Sandals\\n~$140~ $122Zappos\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nFree People Sabine Suede Belt\\n$38Free People\\n8. Excessive accessorization\\nFrom left: Coach, Moschino, Chopova Lowena\\nVictor VIRGILE/Getty Images\\nBag charms were some of the hottest accessories of the previous year, and their playful, highly personalized appeal is bleeding into every other bauble on the market. In a preview of what’s to come, Coach covered spring’s bags in faux stickers and Chopova Lowena sprinkled studs on to hair bows and sneakers. And at labels such as Moschino and Saint Laurent, models walked the runway laden with as much jewelry as they could carry. (Chaotic layering, a close cousin of this trend, also popped up at Miu Miu and Acne Studios.) Start showing off your personal style with gigantic hair bows, sneaker charms, busy necklaces, and layered keychains—more is more.\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nLsvoz Large Velvet Hair Bow\\n$8Amazon\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nMejuri Star Charm\\n$98Mejuri\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nFree People North Star Bracelet\\n$30Free People\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nClare V.

Prep school\\nFrom left: Tibi, Prada, Bottega Veneta\\nAlbert Urso/Victor VIRGILE/Getty Images\\nA distinctly American mode of prep has dominated fashion for the last few years, and 2025’s first catwalks only proved it’s here to stay. But crucially, none of it’s played quite straight: Collars are askew, traditional shirting doubles as dresses, pleated trousers sprout built-in belts or skirts. This preppy, academic look is about knowing the rules and choosing to break them in service of your own take on style.

If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission.\\nA new season means a new start—most excitingly, perhaps, for our collective closets. (I have a feeling you can relate.) With the first major spring 2025 fashion trends hitting the runways and streets, there’s plenty of fresh inspiration to be found right now.\\nAs a shopping editor with a major focus on style, I’ve been keeping a close eye on fashion month street style and spring’s catwalks, taking note of emerging trends in person and online. And the vibe for the year ahead is all about you—projecting a sense of your true self to the world. Sure, that’s the point of personal style, but after a few years dominated by quiet (and, some might say, boring) luxury, it’s now trendier than ever to dress for your own ideal. Accessories like bag charms are popping up everywhere; super-layered looks are the norm; bold styling choices are making staples like everyday leggings and skinny pants feel daring. It’s a sartorial free-for-all.\\nOf course, I also picked up on some more specific pieces, colors, and vibes, should you want a clearer road map for the year ahead. Boho style is officially here to stay, as is classic American prep (and a close cousin influenced by coastal living). And petal pink and pistachio green are shaping up to be the colors of the year, according to labels like Tory Burch, Tibi, and Simone Rocha.

Bohemian daydream\\nFrom left: Chloé, Valentino, Fendi\\nMarc Piasecki/Victor VIRGILE/Estrop/Getty Images\\nBoho’s been back for a year now, but spring’s best runways took the ’70s-inflected aesthetic in its dreamiest direction yet. Sheer fabrics and handicraft detailing abounded in the Chloé, Valentino, Fendi, and Armani collections, which went heavy on beading and embroidery. The attitude extended to hair too; labels like Elena Velez and Cucculelli Shaheen adorned models’ long hair with flowy ribbons and gold jewelry. I’m all for layering sheer pieces and investing in vintage gowns—but you can get the same effect by, say, throwing on a pair of lace tights and leaving your hair messy when you’re off to brunch.\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nAdrianna Papell Beaded Ankle-Length Dress\\n~$329~ $299Amazon\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nMadewell Anouk Platform Clog Sandals\\n$198Madewell\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nDôen Henri Top\\n$220Net-A-Porter\\n$218Dôen\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nJ.Crew Collection Sheer Layered Sequin Skirt\\n$148J.Crew\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nFree People Boca Bow Layer Necklace\\n$48Free People\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nMilumia Floral Lace Pantyhose\\n$14Amazon\\n2. Petal pink\\nFrom left: Brandon Maxwell, Miu Miu, ChanelGeorge Chinsee/WWD/Kristy Sparow/Getty Images\\nPastels always trend this time of year, but I can’t recall a recent season when powder pink felt this fresh. The whisper-soft shade graced too many spring catwalks to count—and while most outfits leaned feminine, they balanced the color’s usual associations with some bite. Pared-back styling made models feel grown-up at Khaite and Brandon Maxwell; Alaïa employed extreme cutouts for some sex appeal; weirdo layering embraced the female gaze at Miu Miu, Valentino, and Chanel. So while you’re welcome to wear petal pink however you wish, the real trend this season is juxtaposition—mixing the airy with the hard-edged. These pieces will get you started.\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nAbercrombie & Fitch Mixed Fabric Bubble Hem Midi-Dress\\n~$100~ $80Abercrombie\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nHollister Soft Stretch Seamless Fabric Longline Baby Tee\\n$18Hollister\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nWilfred Rhyme Blouse\\n$98Aritzia\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nMadewell Slouchy Straight Pants\\n$118Madewell\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nSam Edelman Kallen Sneakers\\n$90Amazon\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nJW Pei Addisyn Shoulder Bag\\n~$89~ $76Amazon\\n3. Elevated athleisure\\nFrom left: Ferragamo, Tory Burch, Tod’s\\nVictor VIRGILE/WWD/Getty Images\\nA decade after normcore turned everyday essentials like gray hoodies and black leggings into fashion statements, luxury labels are once again finding inspiration in the least glamorous pieces in everyone’s wardrobe. At Ferragamo, models looked like they were leaving ballet class; at Tory Burch, the pool; at Tod’s, track practice. None of these pieces (save for that sequined Tory tank) are showstoppers that would look out of place in the gym or on a coffee run—the appeal here comes down to smart styling. Spend a moment considering color, texture, and layering, and your basics will look like luxury pieces.\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nThe Frankie Shop Eva Tank\\n$79Net-A-Porter\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nLululemon Scuba Mid-Rise Wide-Leg Pants\\n$118Lululemon\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nEverlane Laid-Back Half-Zip Sweatshirt\\n$98Everlane\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nCadmus High-Waist Yoga Shorts\\n$15Walmart\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nDesign by Olivia Seamless Sports Bra\\n$17Amazon\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nCRZ Yoga Butterluxe High-Waisted Lounge Leggings\\n$32Amazon\\n4.

Ladies who lunch\\nFrom left: Gucci, Chanel, Louis Vuitton\\nThe Washington Post/Kristy Sparow/Peter White/Getty Images\\nTweed was on everyone’s mind this season, perhaps because loud luxury is back (or maybe because Chanel was in search of a new creative director). Whatever motivated the big swing toward ladylike style, I’m not upset—some old-school elegance is never a bad addition to your wardrobe, trendy or not. Chanel did its usual thing; Gucci and Louis Vuitton found muses in society women; Celine essentially released its version of a Chanel collection, featuring just a hint of camp. So no matter your tax bracket, it’s a great time to invest in a classic dress or a knit cardigan worthy of Jackie O. Keep things from getting too tradwife by introducing some high-low friction with jeans or unexpected footwear like sneakers and clogs.\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nMango Tweed Jacket with Zip\\n$140Nordstrom\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nH&M Tapered Dress Pants\\n$35H&M\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nHobemty Sleeveless Tweed Dress\\n$40Amazon\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nJaxxon Bezeled Pearl Stud Earrings\\n$129Jaxxon\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nBoden Holly Collared Knitted Jacket\\n$190Boden\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nIdealSanxun Tweed Miniskirt\\n$33Amazon\\n6. Slim-cut pants\\nFrom left: Proenza Schouler, Sportmax, MuglerVictor VIRGILE/Estrop/Getty Images\\nWhile much has been made of the return of skinny jeans, we’d like to offer a touch of pushback: This season’s best styles are technically slim, not proper skinny. (It’s a small but important distinction!) Slim-cut pants featured heavily at Prada, McQueen, Sportmax, Mugler, and Aaron Esh, while everyone and their mother has heard about Alix Earle’s recent love affair with the silhouette. The distinction between straight, slim, and skinny varies wildly between my favorite denim brands, but each of the picks below fits tight through the thighs and begins to flare ever-so-subtly through the leg. Style yours with a white T-shirt, a crewneck cardigan, and black booties to go full Parisian chic.\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nH&M Slim-Straight High Ankle Jeans\\n$40H&M\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nFrame Le Garçon Boyfriend Jeans\\n$238Nordstrom\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nMadewell Stovepipe Jeans\\n$138Madewell\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nLevi’s 312 Shaping Slim Jeans\\n~$70~ $49Amazon\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nVeronica Beard Renzo Pants\\n$395Nordstrom\\n$395Shopbop\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nSpanx PerfectFit Ponte Slim-Straight Pants\\n$148Nordstrom\\n$148Spanx\\n7. Pops of pistachio\\nFrom left: Tory Burch, Tove, Simone Rocha\\nVictor VIRGILE/Getty Images\\nWith early-2010s staples like big bags and cropped leather jackets back in the zeitgeist, it was only a matter of time until one of the biggest colors of the era came along with them. I’m talking, of course, about mint green, which is staging a comeback (with a little more verdancy for 2025) as pistachio. I spotted the shade on dresses at Tove and Chloé, bottoms at Tibi and Tory Burch, and accessories at Prada and Simone Rocha. It’s undeniable—and somehow still under the radar. Remedy that with the pieces below.\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nPistola Alessia Dress\\n~$178~ $125Revolve\\n$188Pistola\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nH&M Cotton Shirtdress with Belt\\n$45H&M\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nAbercrombie & Fitch Asymmetrical Button Sweater Tank\\n~$60~ $48Abercrombie\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nJ.Crew Cashmere Shrunken Crewneck Sweater\\n$118J.Crew\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nBirkenstock Madrid Big Buckle Sandals\\n~$140~ $122Zappos\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nFree People Sabine Suede Belt\\n$38Free People\\n8. Excessive accessorization\\nFrom left: Coach, Moschino, Chopova Lowena\\nVictor VIRGILE/Getty Images\\nBag charms were some of the hottest accessories of the previous year, and their playful, highly personalized appeal is bleeding into every other bauble on the market. In a preview of what’s to come, Coach covered spring’s bags in faux stickers and Chopova Lowena sprinkled studs on to hair bows and sneakers. And at labels such as Moschino and Saint Laurent, models walked the runway laden with as much jewelry as they could carry. (Chaotic layering, a close cousin of this trend, also popped up at Miu Miu and Acne Studios.) Start showing off your personal style with gigantic hair bows, sneaker charms, busy necklaces, and layered keychains—more is more.\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nLsvoz Large Velvet Hair Bow\\n$8Amazon\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nMejuri Star Charm\\n$98Mejuri\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nFree People North Star Bracelet\\n$30Free People\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nClare V.

Prep school\\nFrom left: Tibi, Prada, Bottega Veneta\\nAlbert Urso/Victor VIRGILE/Getty Images\\nA distinctly American mode of prep has dominated fashion for the last few years, and 2025’s first catwalks only proved it’s here to stay. But crucially, none of it’s played quite straight: Collars are askew, traditional shirting doubles as dresses, pleated trousers sprout built-in belts or skirts. This preppy, academic look is about knowing the rules and choosing to break them in service of your own take on style. Untuck your shirt or wear your black loafers with white socks; you’ll be replicating styling tricks from some of my favorite shows, including Prada and Bottega Veneta.\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nLillusory Striped Cardigan\\n~$60~ $46Amazon\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nToteme Pleated Skirt\\n$740Net-A-Porter\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nSiliteelon Fitted Button-Down Shirt\\n~$20~ $15Amazon\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nAbercrombie & Fitch Mid-Rise ’90s Straight Jeans\\n~$90~ $68Abercrombie & Fitch\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nBoden Belted Ponte Shirt Dress\\n$185Boden\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nG.H.

Boho Chic In Suede\\nSuede is on track to be a standout for Spring/Summer 2025, on everything from accessories as larger bags to skirts and outerwear. In addition, we can expect to see a growth in matching sets as well, a suede blazer paired with a suede skirt or trousers.\\nThe men\\'s SS25 shows already hinted at this trend, showcasing a 13% increase in matching sets on the runway. For women, the suede fabric in general is expected to grow with +17% among women between July-September compared to the previous year. And it doesn’t stop there, for the beginning of 2025 is suede loafers expected to increase with +30%, mainly adopted by the edgy consumer. The whole bohemian, relaxed yet sophisticated trend will have its return and suede will be the key player for this!\\n\\n1. Ralph Lauren / 2. 16Arlington / 3. Marni\\n2. Yellow Yellow Yellow\\n\\n\\nAlaïa SS25\\n\\nThe color that never fails to radiate—Yellow! From soft, creamy vanilla yellow to the bold richness of saffron, this vibrant hue is set to make waves in Spring/Summer 2025. Vanilla yellow trend is projected to rise by +11%, while saffron yellow will see a +6% increase from April to June, compared to previous years.\\nDownload our Women\\'s Spring/Summer \\'25 Fashion Weeks Report\\n3. Hot Pants as The New Mini Skirt\\nHot pants have emerged as the new alternative to the mini skirt, styled either with bare legs or paired with stockings. On the runway for this season it was featured in fabrics like cotton, knit, sequin, denim, and leather. The shape can be styled in various ways and is either worn with party tops or cozy knitted cardigans. This fashion style is expected to see a +7% increase in popularity from April to June 2025 compared to previous year. For July to September, the shape is forecasted to have a +14% increase particularly embraced by trendy Gen Z consumers.\\n\\nFendi SS25\\n4. Aquatic Wonderland\\nWe can expect aquatic influences in 2025 that go beyond the classic nautical marine aesthetic, instead the inspiration will take us deep into the world of water and everything that exists within it. Think vibrant tiles from a pool, tropical blues that evoke the soothing depths of the ocean, the caudal fin, the shells of aquatic animals, and mermaid-inspired dresses.\\nFor Spring/Summer 2025, we anticipate a trend centered around aquatic influences to evolve. This is indeed a theme for the more edgy, fashion-forward consumer, infused with a touch of fashion extravagance. However, we can also expect to see these influences among mainstream consumers, playing with shades of blue and metallic colors alongside lustrous fabrics. For summer 2025, turquoise is forecasted to increase by +8% compared to the previous summer, while mermaid-inspired elements like sequins and fishtail maxi dresses are expected to grow by +20% and +17%, respectively.\\n\\n1. The Attico / 2. Ralph Lauren SS25\\n5. Elevated and Cute Sportswear\\nIt\\'s not news flash that sports have long been a source of inspiration for the fashion world, but the lines between fitness and style are blurring now more than ever.\\nFor Spring Summer 25, a shift toward softer, more feminine-coded sports like yoga, pilates, and ballet is being shown. Think about effortless more cute elegance with a sporty edge. On the runways, brands like Casablanca and Ferragamo reinterpreted activewear in luxurious fabrics and playful color palettes, placing a spotlight on the feminine side of sports fashion. Sweatpants, which are estimated to see a +25% increase for Spring \\'25 compared to the previous year, are being styled with heels and bags to give off an effortless \"on-the-go\" vibe.\\xa0\\n\\n1. KNWS / 2. Ferragamo / 3. Casa Blanca / 4. Natasha Zinko\\n\\nLacoste SS25\\n6. The Feminine Polo Shirt\\nThis year\\'s runway showcased a more tailored, feminine-fit polo with short sleeves, giving a slightly posh touch to outfits. These polos were often styled buttoned up, adding structure to the overall look. For decades, the polo shirt has been a symbol of casual sophistication in men’s fashion. However, in recent years, this iconic piece has made a stylish shift, becoming just as essential in women\\'s fashion, but with a decidedly feminine twist. No longer confined to its traditional, boxy silhouette, the polo shirt is being reimagined for women with a modern, fitted cut that accentuates the female form. Designers during Spring/Summer 2025 were blending classic elements, like the signature collar and buttoned placket with new shapes and fabrics that elevate the garment from its sporty roots.\\nSlimmer fits, cropped versions, and softer fabrics like ribbed knits and stretch cottons will make the polo shirt shine during 2025. In Europe, during Jan-March 2025, the popularity of Polo shirts is expected to rise by +22% compared to the previous. Later on (April-June) the Short Sleeved Polo is expected to increase +11% and mainly adopted by the mainstream consumer.\\n7. Animal Print\\nFor some fashion people, Leopard print is less of a trend and more of a timeless staple. But in 2024, it dominated our feeds, splashed across everything from interiors to clothing, enjoying a major resurgence in visibility. As we head into 2025, we can expect a fresh wave of animal prints to roar onto the scene. Animal prints are set to become the season\\'s rising stars, with a projected +92% increase from July to September. During the same time period, Leopard and tiger prints, in particular, will shine and is forecasted to surge by +138% and +16%, respectively.\\n\\n1. Ganni / 2. Marcia\\n8. Thong Sandals\\nFlip flops paired with jeans have long been a signature look among the style-savvy in Copenhagen, and this laid-back aesthetic will gain traction across the rest of Europe in 2025. Thong sandals are stepping into the spotlight, and was seen on the runway in various shows as Dior, Burberry and Etro.\\nAccording to data from Heuritech, the popularity of Thong Sandals is set to soar by an impressive +25% (April-June)\\nDuring the same period and even more striking is the projected +31% increase in rubber thong sandals, mostly driven by the edgy consumer.\\n9. Strapless Dress\\nStrapless dresses made a striking comeback on the Spring Summer 2025 runways, blending minimalist charm with bold new textures. Acne Studios showcased a heart-shaped neckline that created an exaggerated silhouette, adding a playful twist to classic black. MM6 Maison Margiela embraced a deconstructed approach, with ruched details giving an edgy twist to the strapless form. At LaQuan Smith, snake-print strapless designs lent a sultry allure, highlighting the trend’s versatile appeal.\\nDuring Spring 2025 (April-June), strapless dresses will increase with +15% and cater to the edgy and trendy consumer with effortless grace.\\n10. All about Asymmetry\\n\\n1. Bottega Veneta SS25 / 2. ALAÏA SS25 / 3. Chet Lo SS25\\nOne-leg pants, flowy skirts, and one-shoulder tops are all fantastic examples of how asymmetry can elevate fashion pieces to new heights, making garments feel both fresh and contemporary. The design introduces an interesting, unique cut to more traditional shapes, and in 2025, we can expect to see even more of this trend.\\nIn Spring 2025 (April-June), asymmetric neck woven tops are estimated to increase by +6%, with significant adoption mainly among Gen Z and Millennials. During the same period, the asymmetric neck t-shirt is projected to grow by +10%, primarily driven by mainstream consumers, indicating great commercial potential.\\nSee our market reports\\n\\nGet contacted by one of our experts\\nBlending artificial intelligence with fashion expertise for predictive analytics on trends\\nFASHION TRENDS\\nEVENTS\\nWEBINARS\\nCAREERS\\nPRICING\\nFAQ\\nCAREERS\\nPRICING\\nFAQ\\nPRESS\\nPress inquiries: press@heuritech.com\\nNewsletter\\n© 2024 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED - HEURITECH |\\xa0 PRIVACY POLICY |\\xa0TERMS & CONDITIONS\\xa0| 66 avenue des Champs-Élysées, 75008 Paris, France'}, {'title': '2025 Fashion Trends: Top 10 Forecasted Key Trends - Heuritech', 'url': 'https://heuritech.com/fashion-trends-2025/', 'content': 'Strapless dresses made a striking comeback on the Spring Summer 2025 runways, blending minimalist charm with bold new textures.

Boho Chic In Suede\\nSuede is on track to be a standout for Spring/Summer 2025, on everything from accessories as larger bags to skirts and outerwear. In addition, we can expect to see a growth in matching sets as well, a suede blazer paired with a suede skirt or trousers.\\nThe men\\'s SS25 shows already hinted at this trend, showcasing a 13% increase in matching sets on the runway. For women, the suede fabric in general is expected to grow with +17% among women between July-September compared to the previous year. And it doesn’t stop there, for the beginning of 2025 is suede loafers expected to increase with +30%, mainly adopted by the edgy consumer. The whole bohemian, relaxed yet sophisticated trend will have its return and suede will be the key player for this!\\n\\n1. Ralph Lauren / 2. 16Arlington / 3. Marni\\n2. Yellow Yellow Yellow\\n\\n\\nAlaïa SS25\\n\\nThe color that never fails to radiate—Yellow! From soft, creamy vanilla yellow to the bold richness of saffron, this vibrant hue is set to make waves in Spring/Summer 2025. Vanilla yellow trend is projected to rise by +11%, while saffron yellow will see a +6% increase from April to June, compared to previous years.\\nDownload our Women\\'s Spring/Summer \\'25 Fashion Weeks Report\\n3. Hot Pants as The New Mini Skirt\\nHot pants have emerged as the new alternative to the mini skirt, styled either with bare legs or paired with stockings. On the runway for this season it was featured in fabrics like cotton, knit, sequin, denim, and leather. The shape can be styled in various ways and is either worn with party tops or cozy knitted cardigans. This fashion style is expected to see a +7% increase in popularity from April to June 2025 compared to previous year. For July to September, the shape is forecasted to have a +14% increase particularly embraced by trendy Gen Z consumers.\\n\\nFendi SS25\\n4. Aquatic Wonderland\\nWe can expect aquatic influences in 2025 that go beyond the classic nautical marine aesthetic, instead the inspiration will take us deep into the world of water and everything that exists within it. Think vibrant tiles from a pool, tropical blues that evoke the soothing depths of the ocean, the caudal fin, the shells of aquatic animals, and mermaid-inspired dresses.\\nFor Spring/Summer 2025, we anticipate a trend centered around aquatic influences to evolve. This is indeed a theme for the more edgy, fashion-forward consumer, infused with a touch of fashion extravagance. However, we can also expect to see these influences among mainstream consumers, playing with shades of blue and metallic colors alongside lustrous fabrics. For summer 2025, turquoise is forecasted to increase by +8% compared to the previous summer, while mermaid-inspired elements like sequins and fishtail maxi dresses are expected to grow by +20% and +17%, respectively.\\n\\n1. The Attico / 2. Ralph Lauren SS25\\n5. Elevated and Cute Sportswear\\nIt\\'s not news flash that sports have long been a source of inspiration for the fashion world, but the lines between fitness and style are blurring now more than ever.\\nFor Spring Summer 25, a shift toward softer, more feminine-coded sports like yoga, pilates, and ballet is being shown. Think about effortless more cute elegance with a sporty edge. On the runways, brands like Casablanca and Ferragamo reinterpreted activewear in luxurious fabrics and playful color palettes, placing a spotlight on the feminine side of sports fashion. Sweatpants, which are estimated to see a +25% increase for Spring \\'25 compared to the previous year, are being styled with heels and bags to give off an effortless \"on-the-go\" vibe.\\xa0\\n\\n1. KNWS / 2. Ferragamo / 3. Casa Blanca / 4. Natasha Zinko\\n\\nLacoste SS25\\n6. The Feminine Polo Shirt\\nThis year\\'s runway showcased a more tailored, feminine-fit polo with short sleeves, giving a slightly posh touch to outfits. These polos were often styled buttoned up, adding structure to the overall look. For decades, the polo shirt has been a symbol of casual sophistication in men’s fashion. However, in recent years, this iconic piece has made a stylish shift, becoming just as essential in women\\'s fashion, but with a decidedly feminine twist. No longer confined to its traditional, boxy silhouette, the polo shirt is being reimagined for women with a modern, fitted cut that accentuates the female form. Designers during Spring/Summer 2025 were blending classic elements, like the signature collar and buttoned placket with new shapes and fabrics that elevate the garment from its sporty roots.\\nSlimmer fits, cropped versions, and softer fabrics like ribbed knits and stretch cottons will make the polo shirt shine during 2025. In Europe, during Jan-March 2025, the popularity of Polo shirts is expected to rise by +22% compared to the previous. Later on (April-June) the Short Sleeved Polo is expected to increase +11% and mainly adopted by the mainstream consumer.\\n7. Animal Print\\nFor some fashion people, Leopard print is less of a trend and more of a timeless staple. But in 2024, it dominated our feeds, splashed across everything from interiors to clothing, enjoying a major resurgence in visibility. As we head into 2025, we can expect a fresh wave of animal prints to roar onto the scene. Animal prints are set to become the season\\'s rising stars, with a projected +92% increase from July to September. During the same time period, Leopard and tiger prints, in particular, will shine and is forecasted to surge by +138% and +16%, respectively.\\n\\n1. Ganni / 2. Marcia\\n8. Thong Sandals\\nFlip flops paired with jeans have long been a signature look among the style-savvy in Copenhagen, and this laid-back aesthetic will gain traction across the rest of Europe in 2025. Thong sandals are stepping into the spotlight, and was seen on the runway in various shows as Dior, Burberry and Etro.\\nAccording to data from Heuritech, the popularity of Thong Sandals is set to soar by an impressive +25% (April-June)\\nDuring the same period and even more striking is the projected +31% increase in rubber thong sandals, mostly driven by the edgy consumer.\\n9. Strapless Dress\\nStrapless dresses made a striking comeback on the Spring Summer 2025 runways, blending minimalist charm with bold new textures. Acne Studios showcased a heart-shaped neckline that created an exaggerated silhouette, adding a playful twist to classic black. MM6 Maison Margiela embraced a deconstructed approach, with ruched details giving an edgy twist to the strapless form. At LaQuan Smith, snake-print strapless designs lent a sultry allure, highlighting the trend’s versatile appeal.\\nDuring Spring 2025 (April-June), strapless dresses will increase with +15% and cater to the edgy and trendy consumer with effortless grace.\\n10. All about Asymmetry\\n\\n1. Bottega Veneta SS25 / 2. ALAÏA SS25 / 3. Chet Lo SS25\\nOne-leg pants, flowy skirts, and one-shoulder tops are all fantastic examples of how asymmetry can elevate fashion pieces to new heights, making garments feel both fresh and contemporary. The design introduces an interesting, unique cut to more traditional shapes, and in 2025, we can expect to see even more of this trend.\\nIn Spring 2025 (April-June), asymmetric neck woven tops are estimated to increase by +6%, with significant adoption mainly among Gen Z and Millennials. During the same period, the asymmetric neck t-shirt is projected to grow by +10%, primarily driven by mainstream consumers, indicating great commercial potential.\\nSee our market reports\\n\\nGet contacted by one of our experts\\nBlending artificial intelligence with fashion expertise for predictive analytics on trends\\nFASHION TRENDS\\nEVENTS\\nWEBINARS\\nCAREERS\\nPRICING\\nFAQ\\nCAREERS\\nPRICING\\nFAQ\\nPRESS\\nPress inquiries: press@heuritech.com\\nNewsletter\\n© 2024 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED - HEURITECH |\\xa0 PRIVACY POLICY |\\xa0TERMS & CONDITIONS\\xa0| 66 avenue des Champs-Élysées, 75008 Paris, France'}, {'title': '9 Fashion Trends That Will Be Everywhere in 2025 - Teen Vogue', 'url': 'https://www.teenvogue.com/story/biggest-fashion-trends', 'content': 'Fashion designers were listening to the siren song of the sea when designing their 2025 collections.

We’ll be looking to the future with the Y3K aesthetic, which began in mid-2024 and shows no signs of slowing down. Just like the Jonas Brothers sang about back in the day, travel to the year 3000 with a mashup of forward-thinking looks.\\nThe easiest way to incorporate the Y3K aesthetic into your wardrobe is with shiny silver and metallic touches, whether that’s with a sleek metal bag or silver pants. But the trend also encompasses a more dystopian vibe, with unexpected, destroyed shapes and silhouettes that make it look like you survived the apocalypse. Mix utilitarian pieces like cargo pants with jackets and tops in cool, edgy shapes for a fun juxtaposition that feels straight out of the next century.\\n\\nCoach Tabby Shoulder Bag 20 In Metallic\\n~$395~ $237Coach\\n\\nNike\\nShox R4 White and Metallic Silver\\n$150Nike\\n2. Boho with an Edge\\nChristian Vierig/Getty Images\\nICYMI, Chloé is back —\\xa0and so is its signature boho aesthetic. Under the wing of designer Chemena Kamali, the beloved fashion line made a big splash in 2024 and had us revisiting the boho-chic era of the mid-2000s. The look is all about flowing dresses and tops in airy materials like chiffon to convey an aura of enchantment and ease. Lace blouses are also a great way to incorporate a bit of boho into your day-to-day life. The more ruffles, the better!\\nMost Popular\\n\\n\\n\\nShopping\\n65 Best Gifts for Teen Boys, According to TikTok\\nBy Marilyn La Jeunesse\\n\\n\\n\\nShopping\\n26 Best Mentor Gifts to Show Your Appreciation\\nBy Iman Balagam\\n\\n\\n\\nStyle\\n10 Best Le Labo Scents That Are Worth the Investment\\nBy Sara Delgado\\n\\n\\nStick to light colors like cream, white, yellow, and pale pink. Just like Sienna Miller in the 2000s, tone down the flowiness with a touch of leather and suede, like a motorcycle jacket, tall boots, or a studded bag. The boho look is a natural match for the Bella Hadid-inspired horsegirl aesthetic; if the horsegirl left the stables and dressed up for the night, this is what she’d be wearing. The boho revival also pairs well with Pinterest’s “goddess” trend, which is all about flowing waves and curls, gold jewelry, and draped, form-fitting dresses.\\n\\nMonki\\nDistressed faux leather jacket\\n$90ASOS\\n\\nZara\\nCotton & Linen Short Embroidered Dress\\n$50zara\\n3. Living Dolls\\nDaniel Zuchnik/Getty Images\\nBarbie hasn’t quite let us out of her plastic grip yet. Though the hot pink heyday of Barbiecore is firmly in the rear-view mirror, dolls are still having a moment. In 2025, expect to see more candy-colored fashion and surrealism-inspired accessories, a la Marc Jacobs’s instantly viral fall 2024 show; as evidence that the trend has (plastic) legs, Kaia Gerber recently wore a head-to-toe Marc Jacobs ensemble on the December cover of Vogue, complete with oversized gloves and a shellacked hairstyle. To bring the doll look to life in your own day-to-day, think of bright colors and cheery pastels, platform Mary Jane shoes, big lashes, and either teeny-tiny accessories like handbags or cartoonishly oversized jewels.\\n\\nMarc Jacobs\\nShoulder Bag\\n$150Marc Jacobs\\n\\nMarc Jacobs\\nPurple 'The Metallic Kiki' Knee High Boots\\n$595SSENSE\\n4.

There’s a new fruit-inspired aesthetic coming in 2025. Though the strawberry girl aesthetic was mostly beauty-driven, the cherry girl look will be the best of both worlds, with the color taking over our closets and our glam routines. Think deep, rich red, just like in-season cherries shining in a bag at the grocery store. This color lends itself well to almost every corner of your wardrobe, from a statement coat to sunglasses to a date-night dress. Even a hair clip counts! Wear it head to toe for the ultimate impact.\\n\\nJADED London\\nBurgundy Brooke Boxing Boot\\n$305Jaded London\\n\\nCoach\\nErgo Bag With Cherry Print\\n$275Coach\\n5.

Leopard print will still be a go-to, but cow print, snakeskin, and tiger stripes are also trending. You can wear animal print anywhere and everywhere, including coats, boots, and jeans. Use it as an accent piece with a bag or shoes, or let it be the focal point of your outfit.

Mix utilitarian pieces like cargo pants with jackets and tops in cool, edgy shapes for a fun juxtaposition that feels straight out of the next century.\\n\\nCoach Tabby Shoulder Bag 20 In Metallic\\n~$395~ $237Coach\\n\\nNike\\nShox R4 White and Metallic Silver\\n$150Nike\\n2. Boho with an Edge\\nChristian Vierig/Getty Images\\nICYMI, Chloé is back —\\xa0and so is its signature boho aesthetic. Under the wing of designer Chemena Kamali, the beloved fashion line made a big splash in 2024 and had us revisiting the boho-chic era of the mid-2000s. The look is all about flowing dresses and tops in airy materials like chiffon to convey an aura of enchantment and ease. Lace blouses are also a great way to incorporate a bit of boho into your day-to-day life. The more ruffles, the better!\\nMost Popular\\n\\n\\n\\nShopping\\n65 Best Gifts for Teen Boys, According to TikTok\\nBy Marilyn La Jeunesse\\n\\n\\n\\nShopping\\n26 Best Mentor Gifts to Show Your Appreciation\\nBy Iman Balagam\\n\\n\\n\\nStyle\\n10 Best Le Labo Scents That Are Worth the Investment\\nBy Sara Delgado\\n\\n\\nStick to light colors like cream, white, yellow, and pale pink. Just like Sienna Miller in the 2000s, tone down the flowiness with a touch of leather and suede, like a motorcycle jacket, tall boots, or a studded bag. The boho look is a natural match for the Bella Hadid-inspired horsegirl aesthetic; if the horsegirl left the stables and dressed up for the night, this is what she’d be wearing. The boho revival also pairs well with Pinterest’s “goddess” trend, which is all about flowing waves and curls, gold jewelry, and draped, form-fitting dresses.\\n\\nMonki\\nDistressed faux leather jacket\\n$90ASOS\\n\\nZara\\nCotton & Linen Short Embroidered Dress\\n$50zara\\n3. Living Dolls\\nDaniel Zuchnik/Getty Images\\nBarbie hasn’t quite let us out of her plastic grip yet. Though the hot pink heyday of Barbiecore is firmly in the rear-view mirror, dolls are still having a moment. In 2025, expect to see more candy-colored fashion and surrealism-inspired accessories, a la Marc Jacobs’s instantly viral fall 2024 show; as evidence that the trend has (plastic) legs, Kaia Gerber recently wore a head-to-toe Marc Jacobs ensemble on the December cover of Vogue, complete with oversized gloves and a shellacked hairstyle. To bring the doll look to life in your own day-to-day, think of bright colors and cheery pastels, platform Mary Jane shoes, big lashes, and either teeny-tiny accessories like handbags or cartoonishly oversized jewels.\\n\\nMarc Jacobs\\nShoulder Bag\\n$150Marc Jacobs\\n\\nMarc Jacobs\\nPurple 'The Metallic Kiki' Knee High Boots\\n$595SSENSE\\n4.

There’s a new fruit-inspired aesthetic coming in 2025. Though the strawberry girl aesthetic was mostly beauty-driven, the cherry girl look will be the best of both worlds, with the color taking over our closets and our glam routines. Think deep, rich red, just like in-season cherries shining in a bag at the grocery store. This color lends itself well to almost every corner of your wardrobe, from a statement coat to sunglasses to a date-night dress. Even a hair clip counts! Wear it head to toe for the ultimate impact.\\n\\nJADED London\\nBurgundy Brooke Boxing Boot\\n$305Jaded London\\n\\nCoach\\nErgo Bag With Cherry Print\\n$275Coach\\n5. Animal Print Everything\\nClaudio Lavenia/Getty Images\\nOh, you thought leopard print was on its way out? Think again! As we saw on the resort 2025 runways, animal print isn’t going anywhere. Leopard print will still be a go-to, but cow print, snakeskin, and tiger stripes are also trending. You can wear animal print anywhere and everywhere, including coats, boots, and jeans. Use it as an accent piece with a bag or shoes, or let it be the focal point of your outfit. Either way, you’re going to want to show your wild side this coming year.\\n\\nPull & Bear\\nCow print baggy pants\\n$60Pull & Bear\\n\\nZara\\nSlouchy TRF Animal Print Jeans with a Mid Waist\\n$60Zara\\n6.

Nautical-inspired looks were all over the runways, and we’ll be seeing them trickle down to our wardrobes, too. A navy and white Breton striped top is an easy way to rock the trend, as is a thick, cream cable-knit sweater; pair either top with loose-fitting, light-wash denim for a chic spin on the fisherman look. In the spring, invest in a raincoat in a cheery color like yellow or red. The sailor look is perfect for casual wear, so style your stripes, sweaters, knits, and raincoats with simple sneakers and maybe a bucket hat for good measure.\\n\\nZara\\nStriped Heavy Cotton Polo Shirt\\n$40zara\\n\\nDamson Madder\\nSailor Denim Jacket\\n$170damson madder\\n7. ‘80s Maximalism\\nAeon\\nAs we said above, maximalism is back. Well, OK, it’s been building for a few years; elements of ‘80s style have been popping up on the runways and IRL for a few years. But 2025 is the perfect time to take it to the next level! Channel the ‘80s with floral print dresses and jackets, bold earrings, embellished tops, and lots of rich, deep, bold colors. Go thrifting for oversized blazers and brocade, then add white tights (another trend!) and heels for a ladylike vibe.

Denim is a cornerstone of basically every wardrobe and 2025 will be a fun year to experiment with your jean looks. Wide-leg, barrel-leg, and baggy jeans will continue to be popular. If skirts are your thing, try a midi or full-length maxi.

Sporty Spice\\nDaniel Zuchnik/Getty Images\\nSwap your athleisure leggings and zip-ups in favor of old-school styles like tracksuits and windbreakers. The sporty trend is set to explode in 2025; the roots of the trend started with the return of preppy fashion and varsity jackets, and in the coming year, we’ll be heading to the gym (or, you know, to brunch) in ‘70s-, ‘80s-, and ‘90s-inspired athletic gear.

Rooted in a sense of “soft power,” which Vogue’s Laird Borelli-Persson connected to designers encouraging “an openness to a sense of wonder” in her analysis of the shows, these trends can be embraced in more ways than one. And key themes can already be incorporated into your wardrobe.\\nConsider spring’s outerwear stories, which reimagine lightweight jackets of all types, particularly sporty styles for the season ahead. For inspiration on how to wear these jackets from now, look no further than Bottega, where an elasticated windbreaker was styled with fluid trousers. A zip-up à la Gucci works equally well here—just throw an overcoat on top. Suede will continue to trend as well, so if you invested this fall, keep wearing it! At Prada, caramel suede was paired with dark grey—a new go-to winter color combo to try in the new year.\\nSpeaking of the new year, it’s the perfect opportunity to refresh your work staples. For the office and beyond, we’ll be seeing new takes on tailoring—both oversized and shrunken—to suit your 2025 style resolutions. There are plenty of relaxed suiting options to add to your rotation right now—make it full look for that inimitable Saint Laurent swagger.\\nAs for the print that reigned supreme on the spring/summer runways? It wasn’t a floral or an animal but plaid. The autumnal pattern was already a favorite this fall, but it seems like fashion wasn’t done with it for spring, rendering it in softer colors and shapes. If plaid was already a trend you incorporated this season, look to the runways for ideas on how to print clash—we saw it styled as full ensembles in various checks, but also contrasted with polkadots and stripes.\\nBelow, a look at the three key spring/summer 2025 fashion trends you can wear now—a running list we’ll continue to update as spring’s coveted deliveries land in stores.\\nRunway: Loewe Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025; Prada Spring 2025; Miu Miu Spring 2025; Gucci Spring 2025\\nPhotos: Courtesy of GoRunway.com\\nSpring Outerwear Stories\\nA sporty sensibility carried over from fashion’s Olympics fervor pervaded the spring/summer 2025 runways. Sabato de Sarno showed various fitted zip-up jackets at Gucci, while Bottega and Miu Miu reimagined the wind breaker—Matthieu Blazy notably lined his in plaid, a carryover from fall we’ll get into next. But other kinds of lightweight outerwear were anlso introduced. At Prada, Miuccia and Raf Simons showed a suede style, proof that fashion’s ongoing obsession with the texture isn’t going anywhere. A cropped leather cape made an appearance at Loewe, upleveling the boho staple we were reacquainted with last spring. Investing in next-season outerwear now doesn’t mean you have to wait until March to wear your pieces—layer similar styles from Gucci and Loewe under heavier coats to maximize their cost per wear.\\n\\nGucci\\nembroidered wool and silk hooded jacket\\n$4,300GUCCI\\n\\nSacai\\ntwill-paneled hoodie\\n$915MYTHERESA\\n\\n& Other Stories\\nbelted patch-pocket jacket\\n$219& OTHER STORIES\\n\\nLoewe\\nballoon jacket in nappa lambskin\\n$7,250LOEWE\\n\\nZara\\nfaux suede jacket\\n$70ZARA\\n\\nSkall Studio\\nGaby jacket\\n$800FWRD\\nRunway: Acne Studios Spring 2025; Kallmeyer Spring 2025; Tod’s Spring 2025; The Row Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025\\nPhotos: Courtesy of GoRunway.com\\nChecks and Balances\\nPlaid may be synonymous with fall—where it indeed saw a resurgence this season—but its presence in the spring collections takes on a softer tune. Borelli-Persson described these checks best as “Nirvana meets Country Living… for any season or type of weather” in her trend report. The Row’s ‘Tavishina’ coat in look 29 exemplifies the fashion mood, with an energizing combination of beige, black, and baby blue squares that was styled with pinstripe pants and a plain white button-up for a harmonious, minimalist-approved take on print mixing. Blazy meanwhile played with a classic color scheme of browns, greys, and white, but showed it as an oversized shacket meets coat hybrid. At Tod’s checks were playfully introduced once more, worn inside out as a full ensemble. In New York, Daniella Kallmeyer furthered the artful drape with a fluid blouse, while Acne Studios dabbled in the art of the clash (nails included!) and incorporated another theme seen in the resort 2025 trends: the bubble hem. This ’90s-inspired look can be achieved now with printed pieces from the likes of Massimo Dutti, Ralph Lauren, or Zara—and styled with pattern opposites for a true runway-coded look.\\n\\nBottega Veneta\\nchecked cotton trench coat\\n$3,900BOTTEGA VENETA\\n\\nDries Van Noten\\ngathered checked crepe maxi dress\\n$2,110NET-A-PORTER\\n\\nRalph Lauren\\nplaid cotton twill workshirt\\n$168RALPH LAUREN\\n\\nMassimo Dutti\\ndraped neck check shirt\\n$120MASSIMO DUTTI\\n\\nAcne Studios\\nsingle-breasted coat\\n$2,150MYTHERESA\\n$2,150SSENSE\\n\\nZara\\nplaid flannel shirt\\n$46ZARA\\nRunway: Tory Burch Spring 2025; Stella McCartney Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025; Saint Laurent Spring 2025; Bally Spring 2025\\nPhotos: Courtesy of GoRunway.com\\nNew Business Codes\\nWe’re leaving the office siren behind for spring, and embracing new tailoring codes for 2025.

[...] The ideal working woman’s outfit is moving toward something easier, more minimalist, and menswear-adjacent, according to spring’s most exciting shows. Loose jackets and trousers anchored office-ready outfits at Victoria Beckham and Saint Laurent. Clean lines defined blazers at Toteme and Tory Burch, the former’s cinched at the waist by built-in belts. Jacquemus and Peter Do showed full, pleated skirts that moved gorgeously—no pencil silhouettes in sight. Thankfully, it’s easy to find similar [...] Mixing equal parts nautical style and East Coast prep, this trend popped up at cool-girl brands like Miu Miu, Sacai, and Proenza Schouler—meaning that it’s primed to be absolutely everywhere in the months ahead. Any coastal references are welcome: Breton stripes, sailor flares, flap collars, boat shoes, seashells, gold buttons, nautical netting.

With the first major spring 2025 fashion trends hitting the runways and streets, there’s plenty of fresh inspiration to be found right now.\\nAs a shopping editor with a major focus on style, I’ve been keeping a close eye on fashion month street style and spring’s catwalks, taking note of emerging trends in person and online. And the vibe for the year ahead is all about you—projecting a sense of your true self to the world. Sure, that’s the point of personal style, but after a few years dominated by quiet (and, some might say, boring) luxury, it’s now trendier than ever to dress for your own ideal. Accessories like bag charms are popping up everywhere; super-layered looks are the norm; bold styling choices are making staples like everyday leggings and skinny pants feel daring. It’s a sartorial free-for-all.\\nOf course, I also picked up on some more specific pieces, colors, and vibes, should you want a clearer road map for the year ahead. Boho style is officially here to stay, as is classic American prep (and a close cousin influenced by coastal living).

Bohemian daydream\\nFrom left: Chloé, Valentino, Fendi\\nMarc Piasecki/Victor VIRGILE/Estrop/Getty Images\\nBoho’s been back for a year now, but spring’s best runways took the ’70s-inflected aesthetic in its dreamiest direction yet. Sheer fabrics and handicraft detailing abounded in the Chloé, Valentino, Fendi, and Armani collections, which went heavy on beading and embroidery. The attitude extended to hair too; labels like Elena Velez and Cucculelli Shaheen adorned models’ long hair with flowy ribbons and gold jewelry. I’m all for layering sheer pieces and investing in vintage gowns—but you can get the same effect by, say, throwing on a pair of lace tights and leaving your hair messy when you’re off to brunch.\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nAdrianna Papell Beaded Ankle-Length Dress\\n~$329~ $299Amazon\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nMadewell Anouk Platform Clog Sandals\\n$198Madewell\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nDôen Henri Top\\n$220Net-A-Porter\\n$218Dôen\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nJ.Crew Collection Sheer Layered Sequin Skirt\\n$148J.Crew\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nFree People Boca Bow Layer Necklace\\n$48Free People\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nMilumia Floral Lace Pantyhose\\n$14Amazon\\n2. Petal pink\\nFrom left: Brandon Maxwell, Miu Miu, ChanelGeorge Chinsee/WWD/Kristy Sparow/Getty Images\\nPastels always trend this time of year, but I can’t recall a recent season when powder pink felt this fresh.

If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission.\\nA new season means a new start—most excitingly, perhaps, for our collective closets. (I have a feeling you can relate.) With the first major spring 2025 fashion trends hitting the runways and streets, there’s plenty of fresh inspiration to be found right now.\\nAs a shopping editor with a major focus on style, I’ve been keeping a close eye on fashion month street style and spring’s catwalks, taking note of emerging trends in person and online. And the vibe for the year ahead is all about you—projecting a sense of your true self to the world. Sure, that’s the point of personal style, but after a few years dominated by quiet (and, some might say, boring) luxury, it’s now trendier than ever to dress for your own ideal. Accessories like bag charms are popping up everywhere; super-layered looks are the norm; bold styling choices are making staples like everyday leggings and skinny pants feel daring. It’s a sartorial free-for-all.\\nOf course, I also picked up on some more specific pieces, colors, and vibes, should you want a clearer road map for the year ahead. Boho style is officially here to stay, as is classic American prep (and a close cousin influenced by coastal living).

Bohemian daydream\\nFrom left: Chloé, Valentino, Fendi\\nMarc Piasecki/Victor VIRGILE/Estrop/Getty Images\\nBoho’s been back for a year now, but spring’s best runways took the ’70s-inflected aesthetic in its dreamiest direction yet. Sheer fabrics and handicraft detailing abounded in the Chloé, Valentino, Fendi, and Armani collections, which went heavy on beading and embroidery. The attitude extended to hair too; labels like Elena Velez and Cucculelli Shaheen adorned models’ long hair with flowy ribbons and gold jewelry. I’m all for layering sheer pieces and investing in vintage gowns—but you can get the same effect by, say, throwing on a pair of lace tights and leaving your hair messy when you’re off to brunch.\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nAdrianna Papell Beaded Ankle-Length Dress\\n~$329~ $299Amazon\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nMadewell Anouk Platform Clog Sandals\\n$198Madewell\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nDôen Henri Top\\n$220Net-A-Porter\\n$218Dôen\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nJ.Crew Collection Sheer Layered Sequin Skirt\\n$148J.Crew\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nFree People Boca Bow Layer Necklace\\n$48Free People\\n\\nCourtesy of brand\\nMilumia Floral Lace Pantyhose\\n$14Amazon\\n2.
